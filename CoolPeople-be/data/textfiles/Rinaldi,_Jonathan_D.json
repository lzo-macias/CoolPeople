A lifelong resident of Queens, Rinaldi has deep roots in the community, having attended local Forest Hills schools and now raising three children, aged 19, 16, and 12, in the same neighborhood he calls home. Rinaldi’s platform is centered on key issues such as health and human services, youth education and child welfare, public safety, infrastructure, and zoning. Rinaldi’s campaign emphasizes the importance of planning and community development in his approach to governance. One of Rinaldi’s most notable legislative disagreements is with the proposal of Bill A6761, which addresses medical decision-making, alongside A2905, which seeks to countermand vaccine mandates. He has also voiced strong opposition to what he describes as ideological impositions regarding transgender issues and college vaccine mandates. Rinaldi’s conviction that “our rights are granted by God” reflects his broader belief in personal freedoms, especially concerning parental rights in education and healthcare decisions. “I believe the money should follow the student. A parent who pays taxes and contributes should have choices—religious, home, charter. There shouldn’t be a monopoly on education,” he said, advocating for funding that supports parents’ choices in homeschooling and religious instruction. Despite his ambitions, Rinaldi’s journey has not been without hurdles. He was not endorsed by the Republican Party, leading him to gather signatures independently to qualify for the ballot. This effort reflects his determination to represent what he describes as “the forgotten voter.” “I’m appealing to the forgotten person/voter,” Rinaldi said. “I want to make sure that everyone is aware of what’s being written, what policies are being written, what legislation is being presented.” The political landscape of Assembly District 28 is also marked by pressing issues like migration and housing. Rinaldi has been critical of the city’s approach to accommodating migrants. “We don’t have a housing problem, we have an illegal alien housing problem because we don’t have any place to put them,” Rinaldi said. “The city can’t afford to house the illegals, so they’re going to be putting them on Section 8.” He argues that the city is overwhelmed and cannot afford to house undocumented immigrants, thereby exacerbating the existing housing crisis.

As a member of the Central Queens Republican Club in Forest Hills, Rinaldi is actively engaging with local civic groups and community boards. He emphasizes the need for residents to be informed about legislative actions and holds elected officials accountable for their decisions. Rinaldi’s commitment to public safety is deeply personal. He recounts a recent incident involving a friend who was carjacked at gunpoint in Forest Hills, a moment that has fueled his desire to create a safer environment for families. Rinaldi envisions a community where crime is significantly reduced. “Children should be able to walk down the street without fear,” Rinaldi said. In his vision for the future of District 28, Rinaldi hopes to foster an environment where parents have full control over their children’s education and healthcare decisions, including vaccination choices. He criticizes the current administration for overreach and advocates for shrinking the size of government. “I want parents to have 100 percent decision on vaccines and other medical choices,” Rinaldi said. “We need to shrink the size of the government if possible.” Rinaldi’s connection to his Jewish heritage also shapes his outreach efforts. He is particularly focused on engaging the Jewish community in his district, stressing the importance of understanding the implications of current political dynamics on Israel and Jewish interests. Looking ahead, Rinaldi has his sights set on more than just winning the election. He is also eyeing potential opportunities to succeed Robert Holden on the City Council, advocating for a proactive approach to governance that prioritizes community needs. He has been vocal about the necessity for the immediate resignation of Republican chair Tony Nunziato, asserting that he does not deserve to be in that seat if he cannot effectively represent constituents. “You do not deserve to be in that seat,” Rinaldi said. “When someone is going to vote in favor of city policies that nobody wants, they need to be held accountable.” As the election date approaches, Jonathan Rinaldi remains focused on rallying support and ensuring that the voices of Queens residents are heard. His blend of local advocacy, personal experience, and professional expertise paints a picture of a candidate determined to bring change to Assembly District 28. In his own words, he aims to “appeal to the forgotten person/voter,” and he is ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead.

Rinaldi’s platform is centered on key issues such as health and human services, youth education and child welfare, public safety, infrastructure, and zoning. Rinaldi’s campaign emphasizes the importance of planning and community development in his approach to governance. One of Rinaldi’s most notable legislative disagreements is with the proposal of Bill A6761, which addresses medical decision-making, alongside A2905, which seeks to countermand vaccine mandates. He has also voiced strong opposition to what he describes as ideological impositions regarding transgender issues and college vaccine mandates. Rinaldi’s conviction that “our rights are granted by God” reflects his broader belief in personal freedoms, especially concerning parental rights in education and healthcare decisions. “I believe the money should follow the student. A parent who pays taxes and contributes should have choices—religious, home, charter. There shouldn’t be a monopoly on education,” he said, advocating for funding that supports parents’ choices in homeschooling and religious instruction. Despite his ambitions, Rinaldi’s journey has not been without hurdles. He was not endorsed by the Republican Party, leading him to gather signatures independently to qualify for the ballot. This effort reflects his determination to represent what he describes as “the forgotten voter.” “I’m appealing to the forgotten person/voter,” Rinaldi said. “I want to make sure that everyone is aware of what’s being written, what policies are being written, what legislation is being presented.” The political landscape of Assembly District 28 is also marked by pressing issues like migration and housing.

He has been vocal about the necessity for the immediate resignation of Republican chair Tony Nunziato, asserting that he does not deserve to be in that seat if he cannot effectively represent constituents. “You do not deserve to be in that seat,” Rinaldi said. “When someone is going to vote in favor of city policies that nobody wants, they need to be held accountable.” As the election date approaches, Jonathan Rinaldi remains focused on rallying support and ensuring that the voices of Queens residents are heard. His blend of local advocacy, personal experience, and professional expertise paints a picture of a candidate determined to bring change to Assembly District 28. In his own words, he aims to “appeal to the forgotten person/voter,” and he is ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead. MOHAMED FARGHALY mfarghaly@queensledger.com In a race that has ignited passions and highlighted local concerns, Jonathan Rinaldi is making his mark as the Republican candidate for New York’s Assembly District 28, which encompasses Middle Village, Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, Rego Park, and Glendale. A lifelong resident of Queens, Rinaldi has deep roots in the community, having attended local Forest Hills schools and now raising three children, aged 19, 16, and 12, in the same neighborhood he calls home. Rinaldi’s platform is centered on key issues such as health and human services, youth education and child welfare, public safety, infrastructure, and zoning. Rinaldi’s campaign emphasizes the importance of planning and community development in his approach to governance. One of Rinaldi’s most notable legislative disagreements is with the proposal of Bill A6761, which addresses medical decision-making, alongside A2905, which seeks to countermand vaccine mandates. He has also voiced strong opposition to what he describes as ideological impositions regarding transgender issues and college vaccine mandates. Rinaldi’s"

This effort reflects his determination to represent what he describes as “the forgotten voter.” “I’m appealing to the forgotten person/voter,” Rinaldi said. “I want to make sure that everyone is aware of what’s being written, what policies are being written, what legislation is being presented.” The political landscape of Assembly District 28 is also marked by pressing issues like migration and housing. Rinaldi has been critical of the city’s approach to accommodating migrants. “We don’t have a housing problem, we have an illegal alien housing problem because we don’t have any place to put them,” Rinaldi said. “The city can’t afford to house the illegals, so they’re going to be putting them on Section 8.” He argues that the city is overwhelmed and cannot afford to house undocumented immigrants, thereby exacerbating the existing housing crisis. His focus on Section 8 housing policies highlights a broader concern about the allocation of resources in an already strained system. His platform prioritizes health, education, public safety, and housing, emphasizing parental rights and community accountability while criticizing current policies on migration and education funding. As a member of the Central Queens Republican Club in Forest Hills, Rinaldi is actively engaging with local civic groups and community boards. He emphasizes the need for residents to be informed about legislative actions and holds elected officials accountable for their decisions. Rinaldi’s commitment to public safety is deeply personal. He recounts a recent incident involving a friend who was carjacked at gunpoint in Forest Hills, a moment that has fueled his desire to create a safer environment for families. Rinaldi envisions a community where crime is significantly reduced. “Children should be able to walk down the street without fear,” Rinaldi said. In his vision for the future of District 28, Rinaldi hopes to foster an environment where parents have full control over their children’s education and healthcare decisions, including vaccination choices. He criticizes the current administration for overreach and advocates for shrinking the size of government. “I want parents to have 100 percent decision on vaccines and other medical choices,” Rinaldi said. “We need to shrink the size of the government if possible.” Rinaldi’s connection to his Jewish heritage also shapes his outreach efforts. He is particularly focused on engaging the Jewish community in his district, stressing the importance of understanding the implications of current political dynamics on Israel and Jewish interests.

Rinaldi has been critical of the city’s approach to accommodating migrants. “We don’t have a housing problem, we have an illegal alien housing problem because we don’t have any place to put them,” Rinaldi said. “The city can’t afford to house the illegals, so they’re going to be putting them on Section 8.” He argues that the city is overwhelmed and cannot afford to house undocumented immigrants, thereby exacerbating the existing housing crisis. His focus on Section 8 housing policies highlights a broader concern about the allocation of resources in an already strained system. His platform prioritizes health, education, public safety, and housing, emphasizing parental rights and community accountability while criticizing current policies on migration and education funding.

Rinaldi envisions a community where crime is significantly reduced. “Children should be able to walk down the street without fear,” Rinaldi said. In his vision for the future of District 28, Rinaldi hopes to foster an environment where parents have full control over their children’s education and healthcare decisions, including vaccination choices. He criticizes the current administration for overreach and advocates for shrinking the size of government. “I want parents to have 100 percent decision on vaccines and other medical choices,” Rinaldi said. “We need to shrink the size of the government if possible.” Rinaldi’s connection to his Jewish heritage also shapes his outreach efforts. He is particularly focused on engaging the Jewish community in his district, stressing the importance of understanding the implications of current political dynamics on Israel and Jewish interests. Looking ahead, Rinaldi has his sights set on more than just winning the election. He is also eyeing potential opportunities to succeed Robert Holden on the City Council, advocating for a proactive approach to governance that prioritizes community needs. He has been vocal about the necessity for the immediate resignation of Republican chair Tony Nunziato, asserting that he does not deserve to be in that seat if he cannot effectively represent constituents. “You do not deserve to be in that seat,” Rinaldi said. “When someone is going to vote in favor of city policies that nobody wants, they need to be held accountable.” As the election date approaches, Jonathan Rinaldi remains focused on rallying support and ensuring that the voices of Queens residents are heard.

    "text": "the Republican candidate for New York’s Assembly District 28, which encompasses Middle Village, Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, Rego Park, and Glendale. A lifelong resident of Queens, Rinaldi has deep roots in the community, having attended local Forest Hills schools and now raising three children, aged 19, 16, and 12, in the same neighborhood he calls home. Rinaldi’s platform is centered on key issues such as health and human services, youth education and child welfare, public safety, infrastructure, and zoning. Rinaldi’s campaign emphasizes the importance of planning and community development in his approach to governance. One of Rinaldi’s most notable legislative disagreements is with the proposal of Bill A6761, which addresses medical decision-making, alongside A2905, which seeks to countermand vaccine mandates. He has also voiced strong opposition to what he describes as ideological impositions regarding transgender issues and college vaccine mandates. Rinaldi’s conviction that “our rights are granted by God” reflects his broader belief in personal freedoms, especially concerning parental rights in education and healthcare decisions. “I believe the money should follow the student. A parent who pays taxes and contributes should have choices—religious, home, charter. There shouldn’t be a monopoly on education,” he said, advocating for funding that supports parents’ choices in homeschooling and religious instruction. Despite his ambitions, Rinaldi’s journey has not been without hurdles. He was not endorsed by the Republican Party, leading him to gather signatures independently to qualify for the ballot. This effort reflects his determination to represent what he describes as “the forgotten voter.” “I’m appealing to the forgotten person/voter,” Rinaldi said. “I want to make sure that everyone is aware of what’s being written, what policies are being written, what legislation is being presented.” The political landscape of Assembly District 28 is also marked by pressing issues like migration and housing. Rinaldi has been critical of the city’s approach to accommodating migrants. “We don’t have a housing problem, we have an illegal alien housing problem because we don’t have any place to put them,” Rinaldi said. “The city can’t afford to house the illegals, so they’re going to be putting them on Section 8.” He argues that the city is overwhelmed and cannot afford to house undocumented immigrants, thereby exacerbating the existing housing crisis. His focus on Section 8 housing policies highlights a broader concern about the allocation of resources in an already strained system. His platform prioritizes health, education, public safety, and housing, emphasizing parental rights and community accountability while criticizing current policies on migration and education funding. As a member of the Central Queens Republican Club in Forest Hills, Rinaldi is actively engaging with local civic groups and community boards. He emphasizes the need for residents to be informed about legislative actions and holds elected officials accountable for their decisions. Rinaldi’s commitment to public safety is deeply personal. He recounts a recent incident involving a friend who was carjacked at gunpoint in Forest Hills, a moment that has fueled his desire to create a safer environment for families. Rinaldi envisions a community where crime is significantly reduced. “Children should be able to walk down the street without fear,” Rinaldi said. In his vision for the future of District 28, Rinaldi hopes to foster an environment where parents have full control over their children’s education and healthcare decisions, including vaccination choices. He criticizes the current administration for overreach and advocates for shrinking the size of government. “I want parents to have 100 percent decision on vaccines and other medical choices,” Rinaldi said. “We need to shrink the size of the government if possible.” Rinaldi’s connection to his Jewish heritage also shapes his outreach efforts. He is particularly focused on engaging the Jewish community in his district, stressing the importance of understanding the implications of current political dynamics on Israel and Jewish interests. Looking ahead, Rinaldi has his sights set on more than just winning the election. He is also eyeing potential opportunities to succeed Robert Holden on the City Council, advocating for a proactive approach to governance that prioritizes community needs. He has been vocal about the necessity for the immediate resignation of Republican chair Tony Nunziato, asserting that he does not deserve to be in that seat if he cannot effectively represent constituents. “You do not deserve to be in that seat,” Rinaldi said. “When someone is going to vote in favor of city policies that nobody wants, they need to be held accountable.” As the election date approaches, Jonathan Rinaldi remains focused on rallying support and ensuring that the voices of"

Rinaldi has been critical of the city’s approach to accommodating migrants. “We don’t have a housing problem, we have an illegal alien housing problem because we don’t have any place to put them,” Rinaldi said. “The city can’t afford to house the illegals, so they’re going to be putting them on Section 8.” He argues that the city is overwhelmed and cannot afford to house undocumented immigrants, thereby exacerbating the existing housing crisis. His focus on Section 8 housing policies highlights a broader concern about the allocation of resources in an already strained system. His platform prioritizes health, education, public safety, and housing, emphasizing parental rights and community accountability while criticizing current policies on migration and education funding. As a member of the Central Queens Republican Club in Forest Hills, Rinaldi is actively engaging with local civic groups and community boards. He emphasizes the need for residents to be informed about legislative actions and holds elected officials accountable for their decisions. Rinaldi’s commitment to public safety is deeply personal. He recounts a recent incident involving a friend who was carjacked at gunpoint in Forest Hills, a moment that has fueled his desire to create a safer environment for families. Rinaldi envisions a community where crime is significantly reduced. “Children should be able to walk down the street without fear,” Rinaldi said. In his vision for the future of District 28, Rinaldi hopes to foster an environment where parents have full control over their children’s education and healthcare decisions, including vaccination choices. He criticizes the current administration for overreach and advocates for shrinking the size of government. “I want parents to have 100 percent decision on vaccines and other medical choices,” Rinaldi said. “We need to shrink the size of the government if possible.” Rinaldi’s connection to his Jewish heritage also shapes his outreach efforts. He is particularly focused on engaging the Jewish community in his district, stressing the importance of understanding the implications of current political dynamics on Israel and Jewish interests. Looking ahead, Rinaldi has his sights set on more than just winning the election. He is also eyeing potential opportunities to succeed Robert Holden on the City Council, advocating for a proactive approach to governance that prioritizes community needs. He has been vocal about the necessity for the immediate resignation of Republican chair Tony Nunziato, asserting that he does not deserve to be in that seat if he cannot effectively represent constituents. “You do not deserve to be in that seat,” Rinaldi said. “When someone is going to vote in favor of city policies that nobody wants, they need to be held accountable.” As the election date approaches, Jonathan Rinaldi remains focused on rallying support and ensuring that the voices of Queens residents are heard."

In his own words, he aims to “appeal to the forgotten person/voter,” and he is ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead. Rinaldi’s campaign emphasizes the importance of planning and community development in his approach to governance. One of Rinaldi’s most notable legislative disagreements is with the proposal of Bill A6761, which addresses medical decision-making, alongside A2905, which seeks to countermand vaccine mandates. He has also voiced strong opposition to what he describes as ideological impositions regarding transgender issues and college vaccine mandates. Rinaldi’s conviction that “our rights are granted by God” reflects his broader belief in personal freedoms, especially concerning parental rights in education and healthcare decisions. “I believe the money should follow the student. A parent who pays taxes and contributes should have choices—religious, home, charter. There shouldn’t be a monopoly on education,” he said, advocating for funding that supports parents’ choices in homeschooling and religious instruction. Despite his ambitions, Rinaldi’s journey has not been without hurdles. He was not endorsed by the Republican Party, leading him to gather signatures independently to qualify for the ballot. This effort reflects his determination to represent what he describes as “the forgotten voter.” “I’m appealing to the forgotten person/voter,” Rinaldi said. “I want to make sure that everyone is aware of what’s being written, what policies are being written, what legislation is being presented.” The political landscape of Assembly District 28 is also marked by pressing issues like migration and housing. Rinaldi has been critical of the city’s approach to accommodating migrants. “We don’t have a housing problem, we have an illegal alien housing problem because we don’t have any place to put them,” Rinaldi said. “The city can’t afford to house the illegals, so they’re going to be putting them on Section 8.” He argues that the city is overwhelmed and cannot afford to house undocumented immigrants, thereby exacerbating the existing housing crisis. His focus on Section 8 housing policies highlights a broader concern about the allocation of resources in an already strained system. His platform prioritizes health, education, public safety, and housing, emphasizing parental rights and community accountability while criticizing current policies on migration and education funding. As a member of the Central Queens Republican Club in Forest Hills, Rinaldi is actively engaging with local civic groups and community boards. He emphasizes the need for residents to be informed about legislative actions and holds elected officials accountable for their decisions. Rinaldi’s commitment to public safety is deeply personal. He recounts a recent incident involving a friend who was carjacked at gunpoint in Forest Hills, a moment that has fueled his desire to create a safer environment for families. Rinaldi envisions a community where crime is significantly reduced. “Children should be able to walk down the street without fear,” Rinaldi said. In his vision for the future of District 28, Rinaldi hopes to foster an environment where parents have full control over their children’s education and healthcare decisions, including vaccination choices. He criticizes the current administration for overreach and advocates for shrinking the size of government. “I want parents to have 100 percent decision on vaccines and other medical choices,” Rinaldi said. “We need to shrink the size of the government if possible.” Rinaldi’s connection to his Jewish heritage also shapes his outreach efforts. He is particularly focused on engaging the Jewish community in his district, stressing the importance of understanding the implications of current political dynamics on Israel and Jewish interests.

Rinaldi has been critical of the city’s approach to accommodating migrants. “We don’t have a housing problem, we have an illegal alien housing problem because we don’t have any place to put them,” Rinaldi said. “The city can’t afford to house the illegals, so they’re going to be putting them on Section 8.” He argues that the city is overwhelmed and cannot afford to house undocumented immigrants, thereby exacerbating the existing housing crisis. His focus on Section 8 housing policies highlights a broader concern about the allocation of resources in an already strained system. His platform prioritizes health, education, public safety, and housing, emphasizing parental rights and community accountability while criticizing current policies on migration and education funding. As a member of the Central Queens Republican Club in Forest Hills, Rinaldi is actively engaging with local civic groups and community boards. He emphasizes the need for residents to be informed about legislative actions and holds elected officials accountable for their decisions. Rinaldi’s commitment to public safety is deeply personal. He recounts a recent incident involving a friend who was carjacked at gunpoint in Forest Hills, a moment that has fueled his desire to create a safer environment for families. Rinaldi envisions a community where crime is significantly reduced. “Children should be able to walk down the street without fear,” Rinaldi said. In his vision for the future of District 28, Rinaldi hopes to foster an environment where parents have full control over their children’s education and healthcare decisions, including vaccination choices. He criticizes the current administration for overreach and advocates for shrinking the size of government. “I want parents to have 100 percent decision on vaccines and other medical choices,” Rinaldi said. “We need to shrink the size of the government if possible.” Rinaldi’s connection to his Jewish heritage also shapes his outreach efforts. He is particularly focused on engaging the Jewish community in his district, stressing the importance of understanding the implications of current political dynamics on Israel and Jewish interests. Looking ahead, Rinaldi has his sights set on more than just winning the election. He is also eyeing potential opportunities to succeed Robert Holden on the City Council, advocating for a proactive approach to governance that prioritizes community needs. He has been vocal about the necessity for the immediate resignation of Republican chair Tony Nunziato, asserting that he does not deserve to be in that seat if he cannot effectively represent constituents. “You do not deserve to be in that seat,” Rinaldi said. “When someone is going to vote in favor of city policies that nobody wants, they need to be held accountable.” As the election date approaches, Jonathan Rinaldi remains focused on rallying support and ensuring that the voices of Queens residents are heard.

He has been vocal about the necessity for the immediate resignation of Republican chair Tony Nunziato, asserting that he does not deserve to be in that seat if he cannot effectively represent constituents. “You do not deserve to be in that seat,” Rinaldi said. “When someone is going to vote in favor of city policies that nobody wants, they need to be held accountable.” As the election date approaches, Jonathan Rinaldi remains focused on rallying support and ensuring that the voices of Queens residents are heard. His blend of local advocacy, personal experience, and professional expertise paints a picture of a candidate determined to bring change to Assembly District 28. In his own words, he aims to “appeal to the forgotten person/voter,” and he is ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead. “I’m appealing to the forgotten person/voter,” Rinaldi said. “I want to make sure that everyone is aware of what’s being written, what policies are being written, what legislation is being presented.” The political landscape of Assembly District 28 is also marked by pressing issues like migration and housing. Rinaldi has been critical of the city’s approach to accommodating migrants. “We don’t have a housing problem, we have an illegal alien housing problem because we don’t have any place to put them,” Rinaldi said. “The city can’t afford to house the illegals, so they’re going to be putting them on Section 8.” He argues that the city is overwhelmed and cannot afford to house undocumented immigrants, thereby exacerbating the existing housing crisis. His focus on Section 8 housing policies highlights a broader concern about the allocation of resources in an already strained system. His platform prioritizes health, education, public safety, and housing, emphasizing parental rights and community accountability while criticizing current policies on migration and education funding. As a member of the Central Queens Republican Club in Forest Hills, Rinaldi is actively engaging with local civic groups and community boards. He emphasizes the need for residents to be informed about legislative actions and holds elected officials accountable for their decisions. Rinaldi’s commitment to public safety is deeply personal. He recounts a recent incident involving a friend who was carjacked at gunpoint in Forest Hills, a moment that has fueled his desire to create a safer environment for families. Rinaldi envisions a community where crime is significantly reduced. “Children should be able to walk down the street without fear,” Rinaldi said. In his vision for the future of District 28, Rinaldi hopes to foster an environment where parents have full control over their children’s education and healthcare decisions, including vaccination choices. He criticizes the current administration for overreach and advocates for shrinking the size of government. “I want parents to have 100 percent decision on vaccines and other medical choices,” Rinaldi said. “We need to shrink the size of the government if possible.” Rinaldi’s connection to his Jewish heritage also shapes his outreach efforts. He is particularly focused on engaging the Jewish community in his district, stressing the importance of understanding the implications of current political dynamics on"

Lewis , Annie McDonough and Peter Sterne | October 3, 2023 By Rebecca C. Lewis , Annie McDonough and Peter Sterne October 3, 2023 News & Politics Campaigns & Elections New York City A Republican candidate for New York City Council in Queens has repeatedly harassed Queens Democrats and other elected officials across the city, to the point where the police have been called on him multiple times and he has faced charges of trespassing. In August, Jonathan Rinaldi – an anti-vaccine activist and self-described journalist who is running as the Republican nominee in City Council District 24 – aggressively confronted his opponent, Democratic Council Member James Gennaro, and challenged him to a debate. Gennaro then referred to him as a white supremacist, and Rinaldi exploded at him. “You talk to me like that, I’m gonna catch you outside and make you, show you what a white supremacist is!” he yelled at Gennaro, according to a video of the encounter published on social media . When Gennaro responded that Rinaldi seemed to be threatening him, Rinaldi said, “Yeah, you better believe it’s a threat. You want to insult me? I’ll whoop your ass!” Rinaldi’s encounters with Gennaro and other elected officials are not hidden; he has posted videos of every one on his TikTok or Instagram accounts. In an interview with City & State, Rinaldi denied ever making threats against any lawmaker or public official and described a conspiracy to silence him. “I’m getting close to the money and that’s why they’re coming after me,” Rinaldi said. “There’s an election in November, why would I call and make threats? That’s insane.” Asked specifically about threatening Gennaro, Rinaldi first claimed what he said was not a threat and then called Gennaro “a snowflake.” Rinaldi has also approached Queens Borough President Donovan Richards on multiple occasions, both in public and at his office. On one occasion in July, Rinaldi showed up at Queens Borough Hall, asking to see Richards’ oath of office and the contract for a migrant shelter in the borough.

Assembly Member Nily Rozic’s office also called the police on him after he showed up at her office in August and refused to leave, Rinaldi said. He returned the next day to try again, and no one answered his knock on the door. “(Rinaldi’s) belligerent behavior is disruptive and he was removed from my office by law enforcement on at least one occasion,” Rozic said in an emailed statement. “Since then, his continued threatening behavior of lawmakers in various settings only serves to corroborate his unsuitability for public office.” On Monday, Gennaro posted on Facebook that “at the direction of the NYPD Intelligence Division,” the outer door of his district office would remain locked and directed constituents to knock to receive assistance from staff. The post also said that constituent services required a prior appointment. “I am not at liberty to discuss the details of why the police are engaged in this matter,” the post reads. “My office is not the only elected official's office affected by this situation.” Gennaro declined to comment to City & State. Rinaldi’s dozens of videos also show him attempting to deliver papers to a variety of elected officials and city offices, including Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, Assembly Member David Weprin and Council Member Linda Lee, the New York City Clerk’s Office and the Department of Homeless Services. In one video, filmed outside the offices of the Department of Homeless Services in July, Rinaldi says that he was handcuffed and issued a criminal court appearance ticket for trespassing. “They told me that they were just following policy, and I refused to leave because I don’t follow policy. But they decided to put me in cuffs and detain me…and they trespassed me,” he says in the video . In August, Rinaldi went to the lobby of a former hotel that had been converted to a shelter and refused to leave or stop filming until police were called. In September, he appeared outside the Creedmoor migrant shelter and asked migrants there to show him their identification, before being told by security that he couldn’t do that. Rinaldi sent City & State images of two criminal court appearance tickets for trespassing, both of which he said were later dismissed. One came from his visit to the Department of Homeless Services. The other came after he began yelling at Richards, Rep. Grace Meng and Mayor Eric Adams at a parade in August. A police spokesperson told City & State that Rinaldi has two arrests on his record. Last week, he was arrested and charged with felony burglary. Rinaldi confirmed that a burglary arrest recently landed him in central booking. He said police arrested him after he, another Council candidate and the owner of a food pantry broke into the food pantry after the landlord locked them out on Sept. 30. In 2020, Rinaldi was arrested for assault in connection with a domestic dispute. Asked about this arrest, Rinaldi said in a text message that the “NYPD has a history… of making up charges.” “Everything they charge me with gets dismissed,” he added. Rinaldi’s videos can border on the conspiratorial. Rinaldi often suggests that the elected officials are illegitimate because their “oaths of office” are not properly notarized as they do not have an accompanying affidavit (which is not actually a requirement under city, state or federal law). He also accuses politicians like Richards and Adams of supporting “child trafficking” and “child prostitution,” language that evokes far-right QAnon conspiracy theories, and refers to the police officers who are called to remove him as “oathbreakers.” Although Rinaldi is the Republican nominee in the general election for City Council District 24, his relationships with other members of the party are strained. A video from July shows him being refused entry to the Whitestone Republican Club where Council Member Vickie Paladino is speaking. Stefano Forte, the vice president of the club and Paladino’s campaign manager, tells Rinaldi that he is no longer allowed into the club’s events. “You rushed the stage last time, you’re not coming in, I’m sorry,” he says. (Forte did not respond to a request for comment.) Rinaldi did, however, appear at a rally with Republican Rep. George Santos to protest the use of the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center’s campus in Queens to shelter asylum-seekers. As of Aug. 25, Rinaldi’s campaign reported receiving $582 in private donations and spending $7,630,"

He returned the next day to try again, and no one answered his knock on the door. “(Rinaldi’s) belligerent behavior is disruptive and he was removed from my office by law enforcement on at least one occasion,” Rozic said in an emailed statement. “Since then, his continued threatening behavior of lawmakers in various settings only serves to corroborate his unsuitability for public office.” On Monday, Gennaro posted on Facebook that “at the direction of the NYPD Intelligence Division,” the outer door of his district office would remain locked and directed constituents to knock to receive assistance from staff. The post also said that constituent services required a prior appointment. “I am not at liberty to discuss the details of why the police are engaged in this matter,” the post reads. “My office is not the only elected official's office affected by this situation.” Gennaro declined to comment to City & State. Rinaldi’s dozens of videos also show him attempting to deliver papers to a variety of elected officials and city offices, including Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, Assembly Member David Weprin and Council Member Linda Lee, the New York City Clerk’s Office and the Department of Homeless Services. In one video, filmed outside the offices of the Department of Homeless Services in July, Rinaldi says that he was handcuffed and issued a criminal court appearance ticket for trespassing. “They told me that they were just following policy, and I refused to leave because I don’t follow policy. But they decided to put me in cuffs and detain me…and they trespassed me,” he says in the video . In August, Rinaldi went to the lobby of a former hotel that had been converted to a shelter and refused to leave or stop filming until police were called. In September, he appeared outside the Creedmoor migrant shelter and asked migrants there to show him their identification, before being told by security that he couldn’t do that. Rinaldi sent City & State images of two criminal court appearance tickets for trespassing, both of which he said were later dismissed. One came from his visit to the Department of Homeless Services. The other came after he began yelling at Richards, Rep. Grace Meng and Mayor Eric Adams at a parade in August. A police spokesperson told City & State that Rinaldi has two arrests on his record. Last week, he was arrested and charged with felony burglary. Rinaldi confirmed that a burglary arrest recently landed him in central booking. He said police arrested him after he, another Council candidate and the owner of a food pantry broke into the food pantry after the landlord locked them out on Sept. 30. In 2020, Rinaldi was arrested for assault in connection with a domestic dispute. Asked about this arrest, Rinaldi said in a text message that the “NYPD has a history… of making up charges.” “Everything they charge me with gets dismissed,” he added. Rinaldi’s videos can border on the conspiratorial. Rinaldi often suggests that the elected officials are illegitimate because their “oaths of office” are not properly notarized as they do not have an accompanying affidavit (which is not actually a requirement under city, state or federal law). He also accuses politicians like Richards and Adams of supporting “child trafficking” and “child prostitution,” language that evokes far-right QAnon conspiracy theories, and refers to the police officers who are called to remove him as “oathbreakers.” Although Rinaldi is the Republican nominee in the general election for City Council District 24, his relationships with other members of the party are strained. A video from July shows him being refused entry to the Whitestone Republican Club where Council Member Vickie Paladino is speaking. Stefano Forte, the vice president of the club and Paladino’s campaign manager, tells Rinaldi that he is no longer allowed into the club’s events. “You rushed the stage last time, you’re not coming in, I’m sorry,” he says. (Forte did not respond to a request for comment.) Rinaldi did, however, appear at a rally with Republican Rep. George Santos to protest the use of the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center’s campus in Queens to shelter asylum-seekers. As of Aug. 25, Rinaldi’s campaign reported receiving $582 in private donations and spending $7,630,"

In August, Jonathan Rinaldi – an anti-vaccine activist and self-described journalist who is running as the Republican nominee in City Council District 24 – aggressively confronted his opponent, Democratic Council Member James Gennaro, and challenged him to a debate. Gennaro then referred to him as a white supremacist, and Rinaldi exploded at him. “You talk to me like that, I’m gonna catch you outside and make you, show you what a white supremacist is!” he yelled at Gennaro, according to a video of the encounter published on social media . When Gennaro responded that Rinaldi seemed to be threatening him, Rinaldi said, “Yeah, you better believe it’s a threat. You want to insult me? I’ll whoop your ass!” Rinaldi’s encounters with Gennaro and other elected officials are not hidden; he has posted videos of every one on his TikTok or Instagram accounts. In an interview with City & State, Rinaldi denied ever making threats against any lawmaker or public official and described a conspiracy to silence him. “I’m getting close to the money and that’s why they’re coming after me,” Rinaldi said. “There’s an election in November, why would I call and make threats? That’s insane.” Asked specifically about threatening Gennaro, Rinaldi first claimed what he said was not a threat and then called Gennaro “a snowflake.” Rinaldi has also approached Queens Borough President Donovan Richards on multiple occasions, both in public and at his office.

Assembly Member Nily Rozic’s office also called the police on him after he showed up at her office in August and refused to leave, Rinaldi said.

The post also said that constituent services required a prior appointment. “I am not at liberty to discuss the details of why the police are engaged in this matter,” the post reads. “My office is not the only elected official's office affected by this situation.” Gennaro declined to comment to City & State.
