Since becoming Public Advocate, the second-highest ranking office in New York City, Jumaane has restructured the office to empower staff to prioritize community engagement, outreach, and service. He has also passed more legislation in office than all previous Public Advocates combined, including key bills that protect New Yorkers in the workplace and those looking for work, shield struggling homeowners from undue tax burdens, increase public safety, and fight discrimination in our housing systems. Prior to serving as Public Advocate, he represented Brooklyn’s 45th District in the New York City Council from 2009-2019. Jumaane is a first-generation Brooklynite of Grenadian heritage. He was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome and ADHD as a teenager, persevering as he came up through the public school system from pre-school to Master’s. After graduating, Jumaane began his career as a community organizer by serving as the assistant director for the Greater Flatbush Beacon School, then later as the executive director of New York State Tenants & Neighbors, where he fought for truly affordable, income targeted housing across the city and state. In 2009, he defeated an incumbent to begin his career as an activist elected official in the New York City Council. During his time at City Hall, Jumaane has championed landmark legislation to create transformational change. In his first term, Jumaane aimed to end the abuse of the NYPD’s use of stop, question and frisk by sponsoring the Community Safety Act. The legislation was enacted despite a veto from then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and helped put an end to unlawful policing practices typically used in communities of more color, while creating the NYPD’s Office of Inspector General to investigate unlawful or unethical practices within the department. As Co-Chair of the Council’s Task Force to Combat Gun Violence, he helped launch New York’s Crisis Management System, which funds Cure Violence Groups that work to reduce shootings through a multi-pronged, community-centered approach. As Chairman of the Council’s Housing and Buildings Committee, he challenged the de Blasio administration’s inadequate affordable housing plan by advocating for more deeply affordable housing to help prevent communities from being priced out of the five boroughs.. Throughout his over decade of service in government, Jumaane never stopped standing with marginalized communities to fight for justice and equity for all, and has never been afraid to put his body on the line. He has been arrested more than any other sitting elected official in New York, standing up for women’s rights, immigration rights, housing rights, and more.

The hard-working immigrants who are part of the fabric of our communities must feel safe in their homes and be able to go to their jobs, schools, and government offices without fear. Equality in Education We must improve the quality of public education for students across all of NYS with a focus on ending the practice of chronically underfunding public schools that serve people of color and immigrant communities. As LG I will draw attention to this inequality, advocate for resources, and support our teachers. Fair and Affordable Housing As a full time tenant advocate and Chair of the NYC Council Committee on Housing and Buildings, I have fought for tenants’ and homeowners’ rights my entire career. Across our entire State we must create more affordable housing, protect rent stabilization and the rights of tenants, promote sensible zoning, and make home ownership more accessible and affordable. Voting Rights New York State lags behind much of the nation in our archaic voting laws and we must do everything that we can to protect and expand voting rights. I support the creation of an early voting period, same-day voter registration, automatic voter registration, and investment in poll worker training. Health Care The health care system in our country is complicated, but our basic values should not be. I believe that every single individual who resides in our country should have access to the health care they need at a cost they can afford. I will work with our State leaders to resist health care cuts coming out of Washington and ensure that all New Yorkers are provided with affordable, universal, access to the care that they need. Legalizing Marijuana We must expand out medical marijuana program to include all those who can benefit from its use. We also should rapidly move towards the full legalization of marijuana that has been massively successful in other states, expunge the State criminal records of past users, and create a pathway for all New Yorkers to benefit economically from this industry, not just a select few chosen by the Governor. Organized Labor Strong Labor organizations in New York State are crucial in ensuring that all workers, not just their members, have safe working conditions, fair treatment from employers, livable wages, and basic benefits. I will fight against National or local efforts to diminish a workers’ right to join a union, and a union’s ability to advocate for all workers. I support more vocational and apprenticeship training programs for our youth, particularly in economically disadvantaged communities. [5] Women’s Reproductive Choice I believe, unequivocally, that women deserve the freedom to make their own health choices and that all women must have access to safe and legal abortions. I will prioritize the codification of Roe v Wade in New York State Law, and will work to elect a Democratic-led State Senate that will finally make that happen. Criminal Justice Reform I will do everything in my power to end mass incarceration and the unequal treatment of people of color in our criminal justice system. Real changes can be made at the State level, including ending cash bail, sentencing reform, providing more mental health services and drug treatment as an alternative to incarceration, and many others. Environmental Protection NYS must have a focused and comprehensive approach to fighting climate change and conserving our natural environment. This should include building green and investing in public transportation in our urban areas, conserving more land across the state, protecting our clean water and public health by prohibiting harmful activity in key areas of the State, and divesting from the fossil fuel industry. Gun Violence Prevention I have chaired the NYC Council task force to Combat Gun Violence and founded the National Network to Combat Gun Violence, finding effective solutions and implementing real changes in our communities. My opponent has received an A rating from the NRA. As LG, I will continue to be a bold voice and leader on gun reform in New York State and Nationally. LGBTQ Rights I believe that we must continue to fight for equality for LGBTQ individuals. I believe in marriage equality and publically supported the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage in 2015. As LG I will use every tool at my disposal to advocate for equal rights for those who identify as part of the"

    "text": "LGBT community. Women’s Equality I will prioritize legislation and action that promotes safe working environments for women, equal pay for equal work, and equal representation in Elected positions, government, and board rooms. I will support programs that give women more economic and educational opportunity, and I will advocate for the passage of laws that help prevent domestic and sexual abuse. Stopping ICE and Protecting Families I have proudly been arrested while standing up against Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation forces. We cannot let right wing, racist actions tear apart the families our friends and neighbors. The hard-working immigrants who are part of the fabric of our communities must feel safe in their homes and be able to go to their jobs, schools, and government offices without fear. Equality in Education We must improve the quality of public education for students across all of NYS with a focus on ending the practice of chronically underfunding public schools that serve people of color and immigrant communities. As LG I will draw attention to this inequality, advocate for resources, and support our teachers. Fair and Affordable Housing As a full time tenant advocate and Chair of the NYC Council Committee on Housing and Buildings, I have fought for tenants’ and homeowners’ rights my entire career. Across our entire State we must create more affordable housing, protect rent stabilization and the rights of tenants, promote sensible zoning, and make home ownership more accessible and affordable. Voting Rights New York State lags behind much of the nation in our archaic voting laws and we must do everything that we can to protect and expand voting rights. I support the creation of an early voting period, same-day voter registration, automatic voter registration, and investment in poll worker training. Health Care The health care system in our country is complicated, but our basic values should not be. I believe that every single individual who resides in our country should have access to the health care they need at a cost they can afford. I will work with our State leaders to resist health care cuts coming out of Washington and ensure that all New Yorkers are provided with affordable, universal, access to the care that they need. Legalizing Marijuana We must expand out medical marijuana program to include all those who can benefit from its use. We also should rapidly move towards the full legalization of marijuana that has been massively successful in other states, expunge the State criminal records of past users, and create a pathway for all New Yorkers to benefit economically from this industry, not just a select few chosen by the Governor. Organized Labor Strong Labor organizations in New York State are crucial in ensuring that all workers, not just their members, have safe working conditions, fair treatment from employers, livable wages, and basic benefits. I will fight against National or local efforts to diminish a workers’ right to join a union, and a union’s ability to advocate for all workers. I support more vocational and apprenticeship training programs for our youth, particularly in economically disadvantaged communities.

Jumaane has also been particularly attentive to the needs of his alma mater Brooklyn College and the rest of the City University of New York system, supporting increased funding as a member of the Council’s Committee on Higher Education.\" \"As a founding member of the Council’s Progressive Caucus, Council Member Williams has helped lead the fight to change the way government serves the people of New York City. By increasing citizen participation and advancing transparency, he believes that New Yorkers will be empowered to better advocate for their communities and to demand greater efficiency and more equitable resource allocation. In 2011, Jumaane became one of the first Council Members in New York City to implement participatory budgeting, a transformational approach to government that engages residents in the process of designing and voting on projects to better their community. Thus far, he has allocated over $2 million in capital funding based on his constituents’ votes, which will go to projects ranging from security cameras, street improvements for senior citizens, park lighting and a college and career resource center. Jumaane has also changed how non-profit organizations serve the district through results-based accountability, an approach to ensure best practices are used to achieve results, increase accountability and increase the return on investment for taxpayers. In October 2012, Jumaane was the lead sponsor of Resolution 1540, which requires Council Speakers to establish a policy that ensures the integrity and transparency of the discretionary funding process. He believes codifying this rule was a key step in transparency and fairness, and he will work towards further improvements that ensure the needs of communities across New York City are equitably met by government. One of these efforts began in February 2013, when Jumaane introduced a series of proposed amendments to the New York City Charter that would address the problems with transparency and parity in the budget process, as well as the imbalance of power between the executive and legislative branches. He has asked all mayoral candidates to formally commit to these reforms. Jumaane has been vocal in his concerns over the way elections are conducted in New York City, including the wait times that he feels have disenfranchised many potential voters. He was a leading voice that successfully lobbied Governor Cuomo to issue an executive order that eased voting for those affected by Hurricane Sandy in advance of the November 2012 general election, and he also helped get the Board of Elections to increase ballot font size and better inform voters of poll site changes following the September 2012 primary election. Jumaane has joined the call for a reform agenda that would address issues with voter registration, ballot design, poll worker training and language access, particularly for the growing Haitian population. Additionally, he is a supporter of instituting early voting and no-excuse absentee voting options. Government’s approach to contracts has also been a focus of needed reform for Jumaane. He believes that an overemphasis on outside consultants have contributed to cost overruns in city programs and mismanagement of projects like CityTime. He has stood by the labor community as they seek fair contracts with the City, standing with the bus drivers in their early 2013 strike and supporting the call to address back pay in future negotiations. Jumaane has also been a leading voice in the City Council on reforming contracting to minority and women-owned business enterprises, co-writing a report in September 2010 on how Local Law 129 of 2005 has fallen short of meeting its own goals; some of the report’s recommendations were incorporated into Local Law 1 of 2013.\" In 2011, Jumaane became one of the first Council Members in New York City to implement participatory budgeting, a transformational approach to government that engages residents in the process of designing and voting on projects to better their community.

In conjunction with a citywide advocacy campaign, Jumaane introduced the Community Safety Act in February 2012, a landmark legislative package aimed at advancing NYPD accountability and oversight while significantly improving relationships between police and the communities they serve. Following over a year of negotiations, the City Council passed Intro 1079, which will establish a NYPD inspector general within the Department of Investigation, and Intro 1080, which will create the first enforceable ban on bias-based profiling in New York City, by veto-proof majorities in June 2012. Following the blizzard of December 2010, Jumaane used his role as chair of the Council’s Committee on Oversight and Investigations to hold citywide hearings on the City’s storm response. As a result of his findings, he introduced and passed Local Law 29 in May 2011, which has improved 311 service during emergencies.

Jumaane has been vigilant in calling for addressing the problems with the 911 call system and increasing diversity within the ranks of the FDNY; he also has fought against the closure of firehouses during yearly budget negotiations. Jumaane values the close relationship he has developed with local law enforcement, working with them on a daily basis to make the 45th District a safer place. He has funded local gun buyback and Safe Surrender programs, in conjunction with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office, to get dangerous weapons off our streets and assist individuals with re-entering society. Working with Community Board 17, he helped start a local Community Observation Patrol; in the future, he hopes to collaborate with them to establish a Community Emergency Response Team that can assist in crisis situations. Jumaane believes our city should hire more police officers and civilianize the NYPD’s clerical and administrative positions, in an effort to reduce overtime costs, increase the number of men and women patrolling our neighborhoods and bring a return to community policing in New York City.\" Concerned about the bloodshed in communities of more color, he worked to found the Council’s Task Force to Combat Gun Violence in September 2011. As co-chair, he consulted with a citywide team of experts to produce a comprehensive report of local, state and federal recommendations to address the supply and demand of gun violence, including the establishment of Youth SHIELD (Safe Havens, Improved Environments, Local Development) in February 2012 to improve crime-affected areas. Through these efforts, Jumaane also helped create the Anti-Gun Violence Initiative in June 2012, which to date has funded almost $10 million in pilot programs across the five boroughs to employ the holistic Cure Violence approach in reducing violence. Locally, he joined with East Flatbush Village, Inc. both in May 2010 to start the 'Not in My Hood' anti-violence march and in July 2012 to begin his 'Occupy Our Corners' campaign, all with the goal of having volunteers and violence interrupters positively engage young people.

To achieve that, he has taken an assertive approach to addressing constituent issues and improving the climate for families, seniors and small businesses alike to flourish. Jumaane has performed community outreach across the district on a wide variety of issues, including holding yearly health and resource fairs, community screenings for breast cancer and brain tumors and free workshops and clinics on legal issues. With the help of his Community Volunteer Corps and his youth group, Students Taking Action Today (S.T.A.T.), he has organized community clean-up days to engage young people in beautifying their neighborhood, donation drives to provide books, school supplies and food to the less fortunate as well as holiday concerts and parties for local senior citizens. Going forward, Jumaane also looks forward to continue advancing entertainment in the community, hosting film screenings and promoting local artists and musicians. One of Jumaane’s primary missions has been to establish a full-service community center in the 45th District. He is proud to have secured funding from City Hall for a feasibility study that represents the first step towards its construction. Jumaane has also allocated millions of dollars in his capital budget towards improvements at local parks such as Glenwood Playground and Paerdegat Park, and he looks to continue exploring ways to maximize the use of current and future open space in the community, such as the creation of community gardens and community murals. Improving the local environment has always been a focus for Jumaane, including his advocacy for home weatherization and solarizing local buildings. One of his legislative priorities is the passage of Intro 966, his effort to address flooding concerns by requiring the Department of Environmental Protection to regularly report inspection, cleanup and maintenance of catch basins. He also seeks to address the health problems that local air quality has created and to improve access to healthy food options, in part through the creation of a farmer’s market pilot program in the Flatbush Junction. Jumaane has been a friend to small businesses, advocating for the reduction of fines by the Department of Consumer Affairs and co-chairing a Council hearing on the restaurant grading system, which called into question the over-penalization of well-intentioned entrepreneurs by the Department of Health. At the same time, he has been staunchly opposed to enterprises attempting to prey on New Yorkers, as he identified with the emergence of internet sweepstakes cafés engaged in illegal activity. In May 2013, he led the passage of Local Law 45, which will require the mandatory revocation of an amusement arcade or gaming cafe license for engaging in unlawful gambling. Jumaane has organized business corridor forums to assist local small businesses, has begun efforts to help establish a business improvement district on Utica Avenue as well as a merchants’ association on Nostrand Avenue and is exploring ways to help brand the 'Little Caribbean', all in an effort to help spur economic activity. Transportation safety is a growing concern in the community which Jumaane is helping to address. After labeling part of his district the 'East Flatbush Motorist Danger Zone', the Department of Transportation partnered with him to address a problem intersection at Kings Highway and Foster Avenue in May 2013.

Jumaane has also allocated millions of dollars in his capital budget towards improvements at local parks such as Glenwood Playground and Paerdegat Park, and he looks to continue exploring ways to maximize the use of current and future open space in the community, such as the creation of community gardens and community murals.

He also seeks to address the health problems that local air quality has created and to improve access to healthy food options, in part through the creation of a farmer’s market pilot program in the Flatbush Junction.

At the same time, he has been staunchly opposed to enterprises attempting to prey on New Yorkers, as he identified with the emergence of internet sweepstakes cafés engaged in illegal activity. In May 2013, he led the passage of Local Law 45, which will require the mandatory revocation of an amusement arcade or gaming cafe license for engaging in unlawful gambling.

    "text": "Flatbush Junction and will consider how bus rapid transit and other public transportation improvements could enhance the quality of life of his constituency.\" Jumaane has performed community outreach across the district on a wide variety of issues, including holding yearly health and resource fairs, community screenings for breast cancer and brain tumors and free workshops and clinics on legal issues. With the help of his Community Volunteer Corps and his youth group, Students Taking Action Today (S.T.A.T.), he has organized community clean-up days to engage young people in beautifying their neighborhood, donation drives to provide books, school supplies and food to the less fortunate as well as holiday concerts and parties for local senior citizens. Going forward, Jumaane also looks forward to continue advancing entertainment in the community, hosting film screenings and promoting local artists and musicians. One of Jumaane’s primary missions has been to establish a full-service community center in the 45th District. He is proud to have secured funding from City Hall for a feasibility study that represents the first step towards its construction. Jumaane has also allocated millions of dollars in his capital budget towards improvements at local parks such as Glenwood Playground and Paerdegat Park, and he looks to continue exploring ways to maximize the use of current and future open space in the community, such as the creation of community gardens and community murals. Improving the local environment has always been a focus for Jumaane, including his advocacy for home weatherization and solarizing local buildings. One of his legislative priorities is the passage of Intro 966, his effort to address flooding concerns by requiring the Department of Environmental Protection to regularly report inspection, cleanup and maintenance of catch basins. He also seeks to address the health problems that local air quality has created and to improve access to healthy food options, in part through the creation of a farmer’s market pilot program in the Flatbush Junction. Jumaane has been a friend to small businesses, advocating for the reduction of fines by the Department of Consumer Affairs and co-chairing a Council hearing on the restaurant grading system, which called into question the over-penalization of well-intentioned entrepreneurs by the Department of Health. At the same time, he has been staunchly opposed to enterprises attempting to prey on New Yorkers, as he identified with the emergence of internet sweepstakes cafés engaged in illegal activity. In May 2013, he led the passage of Local Law 45, which will require the mandatory revocation of an amusement arcade or gaming cafe license for engaging in unlawful gambling. Jumaane has organized business corridor forums to assist local small businesses, has begun efforts to help establish a business improvement district on Utica Avenue as well as a merchants’ association on Nostrand Avenue and is exploring ways to help brand the 'Little Caribbean', all in an effort to help spur economic activity. Transportation safety is a growing concern in the community which Jumaane is helping to address. After labeling part of his district the 'East Flatbush Motorist Danger Zone', the Department of Transportation partnered with him to address a problem intersection at Kings Highway and Foster Avenue in May 2013. He will continue to monitor issues of speeding and traffic congestion that pose challenges to pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike, proposing solutions like neighborhood slow zones in Midwood and speed cameras near schools. Jumaane looks forward to the improvements that the new Streetscape project will bring to the Flatbush Junction and will consider how bus rapid transit and other public transportation improvements could enhance the quality of life of his constituency.\" See also See also 2025 Elections Government Newsletters External links External links Search Google News for this topic Candidate New York City Public Advocate Website Candidate New York City Public Advocate Website Officeholder New York City Public Advocate Website Facebook Instagram YouTube Officeholder New York City Public Advocate Website Facebook Instagram YouTube Personal Website Facebook Instagram Personal Website Facebook Instagram Footnotes Footnotes ↑ 1.0 1.1 Jumaane Williams' 2022 campaign website , \"About,\" accessed June 1, 2022 ↑ 1.0 1.1 Jumaane Williams' 2022 campaign website , \"About,\" accessed June 1, 2022 ↑ Gotham Gazette , \"23 Candidates Submit Petitions to Get on February 26 Public Advocate Ballot,\" January 15, 2019 ↑ Gotham Gazette , \"23 Candidates Submit Petitions to Get on February 26 Public Advocate Ballot,\" January 15, 2019 ↑ New York Election Law , \"Sec 6-160.

Press Room NYC Public Advocate Calls To End Flawed NYPC Gang Database, Improve Actual Public Safety February 24th, 2025 Press Release Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams today joined the New York City Council Committee on Public Safety to call for an end to the NYPD's Criminal Group Database (CGD), also known as the gang database. In his remarks before the committee, the Public Advocate underscored the disproportionate impact of the database on Black and Hispanic youth, the lack of transparency around its criteria for inclusion, and the harm it causes to individuals and communities. “It is unclear how or why an individual gets added to the CGD, and it is even less clear how someone can get themselves removed from it,” said Public Advocate Williams . “Wishing a gang member a happy birthday on social media, being outside late and wearing a certain color, and living in the same public housing complex as accused gang members are all potential reasons for a person to be added to the database.” The database currently contains approximately 16,000 names, with 99 percent of individuals identified as Black or Hispanic and 98 percent as male. It includes minors as young as 13 years old. The Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD has reported that the department has violated its own database entry and renewal processes, failing to provide sufficient guidance for inclusion and review. Today’s hearing included testimony on Intro 798 , legislation sponsored by Council Member Althea Stevens and co-sponsored by the Public Advocate, which seeks to abolish the database, prohibit the establishment of a similar system, and ensure individuals are notified if they have been listed in the database. The bill would also provide a process for individuals to request and review records before the database is dismantled. “Being labeled as a gang member by the police, wrongfully or otherwise, often results in increased police harassment, stops, and arrests. This interrupts schooling and employment, and can even result in incarceration. It is also a waste of police resources that could otherwise be used to respond to or solve crimes,” the Public Advocate continued. “We should be focusing our resources on strengthening communities and supporting young people who are at risk for violence, many of whom have been victims of violence themselves. I agree; we should be using the time and money spent on criminalizing youth and young adults of color on investing in education, different violence models, employment programs, affordable housing, and health services.” The Public Advocate reiterated that the issue is not necessarily police presence but rather the misuse of law enforcement resources and the failure to invest in community-driven solutions. He urged the Council and the administration to shift focus from punitive measures to meaningful investments in the well-being of vulnerable communities. The Public Advocate’s full opening comments as delivered are below. He also questioned the administration’s representatives multiple times – see those discussions here . STATEMENT OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE JUMAANE D. WILLIAMS TO THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY FEBRUARY 24, 2025 Thank you Mr. Chair, I appreciate it, and I also want to note, it is also before noon and I am present. Good morning, My name is Jumaane D. Williams, and I am the Public Advocate for the City of New York. I would like to thank Chair Salaam and the members of the Committee on Public Safety for holding this important hearing. Since 2013, the NYPD has maintained a database of what they characterize as intelligence regarding criminal groups and street gangs. This Criminal Group Database (CGD)—or, as it is colloquially called, the “gang database”—according to the NYPD, contains about 16,000 entries and allows them to discern trends, relationships and patterns to enhance public safety and criminal investigations. However, advocates, lawyers, and individuals in the database themselves report that it is largely full of men and boys of more color, many of whom have no gang affiliation at all. It is unclear how or why an individual gets added to the CGD, and it is even less clear how someone can get themselves removed from it. Wishing a gang member a happy birthday on social media, being outside late and wearing a certain color, and living in the same public housing complex as accused gang members are all potential reasons for a person to be added to the database. In the last few"

STATEMENT OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE JUMAANE D. WILLIAMS TO THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY FEBRUARY 24, 2025 Thank you Mr. Chair, I appreciate it, and I also want to note, it is also before noon and I am present. Good morning, My name is Jumaane D. Williams, and I am the Public Advocate for the City of New York. I would like to thank Chair Salaam and the members of the Committee on Public Safety for holding this important hearing. Since 2013, the NYPD has maintained a database of what they characterize as intelligence regarding criminal groups and street gangs. This Criminal Group Database (CGD)—or, as it is colloquially called, the “gang database”—according to the NYPD, contains about 16,000 entries and allows them to discern trends, relationships and patterns to enhance public safety and criminal investigations. However, advocates, lawyers, and individuals in the database themselves report that it is largely full of men and boys of more color, many of whom have no gang affiliation at all. It is unclear how or why an individual gets added to the CGD, and it is even less clear how someone can get themselves removed from it. Wishing a gang member a happy birthday on social media, being outside late and wearing a certain color, and living in the same public housing complex as accused gang members are all potential reasons for a person to be added to the database.

    "text": "New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams About Community Engagement Policy & Legislation Press Opportunities Get Help! Press Room NYC Public Advocate Calls To End Flawed NYPC Gang Database, Improve Actual Public Safety February 24th, 2025 Press Release Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams today joined the New York City Council Committee on Public Safety to call for an end to the NYPD's Criminal Group Database (CGD), also known as the gang database. In his remarks before the committee, the Public Advocate underscored the disproportionate impact of the database on Black and Hispanic youth, the lack of transparency around its criteria for inclusion, and the harm it causes to individuals and communities. “It is unclear how or why an individual gets added to the CGD, and it is even less clear how someone can get themselves removed from it,” said Public Advocate Williams . “Wishing a gang member a happy birthday on social media, being outside late and wearing a certain color, and living in the same public housing complex as accused gang members are all potential reasons for a person to be added to the database.” The database currently contains approximately 16,000 names, with 99 percent of individuals identified as Black or Hispanic and 98 percent as male. It includes minors as young as 13 years old. The Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD has reported that the department has violated its own database entry and renewal processes, failing to provide sufficient guidance for inclusion and review. Today’s hearing included testimony on Intro 798 , legislation sponsored by Council Member Althea Stevens and co-sponsored by the Public Advocate, which seeks to abolish the database, prohibit the establishment of a similar system, and ensure individuals are notified if they have been listed in the database. The bill would also provide a process for individuals to request and review records before the database is dismantled. “Being labeled as a gang member by the police, wrongfully or otherwise, often results in increased police harassment, stops, and arrests. This interrupts schooling and employment, and can even result in incarceration. It is also a waste of police resources that could otherwise be used to respond to or solve crimes,” the Public Advocate continued. “We should be focusing our resources on strengthening communities and supporting young people who are at risk for violence, many of whom have been victims of violence themselves. I agree; we should be using the time and money spent on criminalizing youth and young adults of color on investing in education, different violence models, employment programs, affordable housing, and health services.” The Public Advocate reiterated that the issue is not necessarily police presence but rather the misuse of law enforcement resources and the failure to invest in community-driven solutions.

I think anyone who uses social media can relate to posting something without thinking or something that was misconstrued—it does not mean that they are admitting to being in a gang. A report from the OIG-NYPD found that 99 percent of those in the CGD are Black or Hispanic, 98 percent male, and contains kids as young as 13 years old. These demographics are reminiscent of the abuses of stop, question and frisk; in 2023, 59 percent of Terry stops were of Black people, and 30 percent were Hispanic. In a city that is 36 percent white, this looks like a disproportionate targeting of certain communities. Being labeled as a gang member by the police, wrongfully or otherwise, often results in increased police harassment, stops, and arrests. This interrupts schooling and employment, and can even result in incarceration. It is also a waste of police resources that could otherwise be used to respond to or solve crimes. Individuals labeled as gang members face obstacles in court, as prosecutors can raise alleged “dangerousness” when judges set bail, and claiming gang affiliation can easily color a jury’s perception of a defendant. It is a damaging allegation that is almost impossible for someone to refute. Contact with the criminal legal system can cost a NYCHA resident their housing, which is especially troubling given gang takeovers appear to target public housing and the surrounding communities. And while we don’t know if gang takedowns in NYC have led to deportations, the gang label presents serious and unique legal problems for noncitizens. With President Trump in office and Mayor Adams collaborating with immigration enforcement at the behest of the administration, it is especially urgent to ensure that we are not mislabeling people as gang members. Today, we are hearing some bills including Intro 798, sponsored by Councilmember Stevens and of which I am a co-sponsor, which would abolish the Criminal Group Database and would prohibit a similar database from being established. It would also require notification to those in the database, as well as instruction for how they could request records contained in the database before it is destroyed. It is important to abolish the CGD for a number of reasons, including the fact that the NYPD has violated its database entry and renewal processes, including renewing inclusion of minors in the database without qualifying police contact, and it does not provide sufficient guidance for gang database entry and lacks enforcement in its review processes. The NYPD has also historically been resistant to these types of changes. We should instead try to focus our resources on strengthening communities and supporting young people who are at risk for violence, many of whom have been victims of violence themselves. At a hearing of this committee this past December, former Chief of Department Maddrey acknowledged that the NYPD has an increased presence in under-resourced communities, and that he wishes the city would bring more resources to those neighborhoods. I agree; we should be using the time and money spent on criminalizing youth and young adults of color on investing in education, different violence models, employment programs, affordable housing, and health services. We know what works to prevent crime and violence. We also know that simply trying to arrest the children of the people arrested twenty years ago will not get there. I just want to also be clear: the issue for me is not necessarily police involvement. It is the consistent over-policing. Some of the takedowns that are happening, we have to come back several years later to do the same takedowns, because we haven't done any changes in those communities. Oftentimes I see in the news, these type of bills that are problems and they present violence from gangs themselves, even those these bills, so what it looks like some of the things we are doing aren’t working generationally, and it doesn't seem like a database like this stops the violence that we want to stop, but can cause additional harm to people who are not part of the legal system, that now may fall into further more problems in the legal system, because they were put there in the first place.

A report from the OIG-NYPD found that 99 percent of those in the CGD are Black or Hispanic, 98 percent male, and contains kids as young as 13 years old. These demographics are reminiscent of the abuses of stop, question and frisk; in 2023, 59 percent of Terry stops were of Black people, and 30 percent were Hispanic. In a city that is 36 percent white, this looks like a disproportionate targeting of certain communities. Being labeled as a gang member by the police, wrongfully or otherwise, often results in increased police harassment, stops, and arrests. This interrupts schooling and employment, and can even result in incarceration. It is also a waste of police resources that could otherwise be used to respond to or solve crimes. Individuals labeled as gang members face obstacles in court, as prosecutors can raise alleged “dangerousness” when judges set bail, and claiming gang affiliation can easily color a jury’s perception of a defendant. It is a damaging allegation that is almost impossible for someone to refute. Contact with the criminal legal system can cost a NYCHA resident their housing, which is especially troubling given gang takeovers appear to target public housing and the surrounding communities. And while we don’t know if gang takedowns in NYC have led to deportations, the gang label presents serious and unique legal problems for noncitizens. With President Trump in office and Mayor Adams collaborating with immigration enforcement at the behest of the administration, it is especially urgent to ensure that we are not mislabeling people as gang members. Today, we are hearing some bills including Intro 798, sponsored by Councilmember Stevens and of which I am a co-sponsor, which would abolish the Criminal Group Database and would prohibit a similar database from being established. It would also require notification to those in the database, as well as instruction for how they could request records contained in the database before it is destroyed. It is important to abolish the CGD for a number of reasons, including the fact that the NYPD has violated its database entry and renewal processes, including renewing inclusion of minors in the database without qualifying police contact, and it does not provide sufficient guidance for gang database entry and lacks enforcement in its review processes. The NYPD has also historically been resistant to these types of changes. We should instead try to focus our resources on strengthening communities and supporting young people who are at risk for violence, many of whom have been victims of violence themselves. At a hearing of this committee this past December, former Chief of Department Maddrey acknowledged that the NYPD has an increased presence in under-resourced communities, and that he wishes the city would bring more resources to those neighborhoods. I agree; we should be using the time and money spent on criminalizing youth and young adults of color on investing in education, different violence models, employment programs, affordable housing, and health services. We know what works to prevent crime and violence. We also know that simply trying to arrest the children of the people arrested twenty years ago will not get there. I just want to also be clear: the issue for me is not necessarily police involvement. It is the consistent over-policing. Some of the takedowns that are happening, we have to come back several years later to do the same takedowns, because we haven't done any changes in those communities. Oftentimes I see in the news, these type of bills that are problems and they present violence from gangs themselves, even those these bills, so what it looks like some of the things we are doing aren’t working generationally, and it doesn't seem like a database like this stops the violence that we want to stop,"

So that is the issue that we are trying to fix. I don’t want the media to think that people up here are trying to promote violence, want violence in their communities, quite the opposite, we want it to stop. We also, in my opinion, want to stop asking the police to do everything and try to solve everything. It’s unfair to them and it’s unfair to the communities that they’re asked to solve these problems in. Search Media Inquiries: Categories: Our Office David N.
