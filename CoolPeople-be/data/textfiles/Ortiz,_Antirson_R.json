Ortiz for City Council District 17 Candidate Name: Antirson R. Ortiz Office Seeking Election for: New York City Council District 17 Campaign Website: https://ortizforthebronx.com 1. Based upon your life experiences and accomplishments, why do you believe you are best qualified to represent your district? I am an Afro-Dominican, born in the Dominican Republic and raised in the South Bronx. A proud product of the public education system and a member of a family of educators, I have devoted my life to grassroots organizing and public service. Currently, I am the State Committeeman for the 85th NYS Assembly District and NYC Director of Constituent Services at the Office of the Comptroller. As Director of Constituent Services, I oversee the public interface operations across all five boroughs, assisting thousands of families each year with quality-of-life concerns and navigating government processes. However, I began my career as a Youth Counselor in the South Bronx and West Harlem, spearheading school-based initiatives designed to empower youth and connect families to essential community resources. I then transitioned to roles such as Office Manager for Assemblyman Marcos A. Crespo, Bronx Borough Liaison for former NYC Comptroller Scott M. Stringer and being an NYPD Auxiliary Police Officer, prior to my current incumbencies. My core values are rooted in community empowerment, equity and justice, education, and accountability. I am running because my life's work has been dedicated to helping people, and I am deeply committed to bringing strong, well-prepared leadership to our city. We need a voice that will unapologetically advocate for critical issues such as: building a safer community, ensuring affordable housing and homeownership for all, improving our educational system for youth,together with fostering innovative careers, job opportunities, and entrepreneurship for everyone. Our city deserves leadership that will tirelessly fight for these changes and will serve as a renewing hope 2. What LGBTQ organizations have you been involved with, either on a volunteer basis or professionally? What LGBTQ candidates have you endorsed? I have long supported leaders committed to equality, including backing candidates like Ritchie Torres at the start of his government career and when running for congress. Through my roles in public service, I’ve actively participated in community outreach events hosted by LGBTQ organizations, where I provided on-site constituent services to ensure our government remains accessible and responsive to all. 3. If you receive our endorsement, do you agree to identify the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club on all literature and electronic materials? Yes 4. What press conferences, demonstrations, rallies and protests in support of LGBT issues, pro-choice legislation, racial justice, criminal justice have you attended, including rallies specifically against Donald Trump? In my government roles, I have attended numerous rallies over the years, representing the elected officials I served at the time. Most recently, I marched alongside the Working Families Party during the Hands Off demonstration, continuing my commitment to advocacy and grassroots action. 5. In light of the upcoming Trump Administration’s war on women, the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities and immigrants, what are your plans to organize and combat the Trump agenda? In the face of the upcoming Trump administration’s attacks on women, the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities, and immigrants, we must organize with urgency and stand united with community leaders, grassroots organizations, and advocacy groups across our city. From defending reproductive rights and trans lives to protecting immigrants and communities of color, we will resist through direct action, mutual collaboration, and results-driven political engagement. As a City Council Member, I will organize and coordinate town halls to educate our constituents on what’s at stake and how laws and policies impact our communities and what are their rights, while using digital platforms to uplift and amplify underrepresented voices. Alongside my colleagues in government and advocacy organizations, we will craft and advance strong legislative policies"

Ortiz for City Council District 17 Candidate Name: Antirson R. Ortiz Office Seeking Election for: New York City Council District 17 Campaign Website: https://ortizforthebronx.com 1. Based upon your life experiences and accomplishments, why do you believe you are best qualified to represent your district? I am an Afro-Dominican, born in the Dominican Republic and raised in the South Bronx. A proud product of the public education system and a member of a family of educators, I have devoted my life to grassroots organizing and public service. Currently, I am the State Committeeman for the 85th NYS Assembly District and NYC Director of Constituent Services at the Office of the Comptroller. As Director of Constituent Services, I oversee the public interface operations across all five boroughs, assisting thousands of families each year with quality-of-life concerns and navigating government processes. However, I began my career as a Youth Counselor in the South Bronx and West Harlem, spearheading school-based initiatives designed to empower youth and connect families to essential community resources. I then transitioned to roles such as Office Manager for Assemblyman Marcos A. Crespo, Bronx Borough Liaison for former NYC Comptroller Scott M. Stringer and being an NYPD Auxiliary Police Officer, prior to my current incumbencies. My core values are rooted in community empowerment, equity and justice, education, and accountability. I am running because my life's work has been dedicated to helping people, and I am deeply committed to bringing strong, well-prepared leadership to our city. We need a voice that will unapologetically advocate for critical issues such as: building a safer community, ensuring affordable housing and homeownership for all, improving our educational system for youth,together with fostering innovative careers, job opportunities, and entrepreneurship for everyone. Our city deserves leadership that will tirelessly fight for these changes and will serve as a renewing hope 2. What LGBTQ organizations have you been involved with, either on a volunteer basis or professionally? What LGBTQ candidates have you endorsed? I have long supported leaders committed to equality, including backing candidates like Ritchie Torres at the start of his government career and when running for congress. Through my roles in public service, I’ve actively participated in community outreach events hosted by LGBTQ organizations, where I provided on-site constituent services to ensure our government remains accessible and responsive to all. 3. If you receive our endorsement, do you agree to identify the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club on all literature and electronic materials? Yes 4. What press conferences, demonstrations, rallies and protests in support of LGBT issues, pro-choice legislation, racial justice, criminal justice have you attended, including rallies specifically against Donald Trump? In my government roles, I have attended numerous rallies over the years, representing the elected officials I served at the time. Most recently, I marched alongside the Working Families Party during the Hands Off demonstration, continuing my commitment to advocacy and grassroots action. 5. In light of the upcoming Trump Administration’s war on women, the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities and immigrants, what are your plans to organize and combat the Trump agenda? In the face of the upcoming Trump administration’s attacks on women, the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities, and immigrants, we must organize with urgency and stand united with community leaders, grassroots organizations, and advocacy groups across our city. From defending reproductive rights and trans lives to protecting immigrants and communities of color, we will resist through direct action, mutual collaboration, and results-driven political engagement. As a City Council Member, I will organize and coordinate town halls to educate our constituents on what’s at stake and how laws and policies impact our communities and what are their rights, while using digital platforms to uplift and amplify underrepresented voices. Alongside my colleagues in government and advocacy organizations, we will craft and advance strong legislative policies"

What proposals will do you support to increase the protection of immigrants and cement New York City’s status as a Sanctuary City? To enhance protections for immigrants and reaffirm New York City's status as a Sanctuary City, I support key legislative and policy initiatives, including those introduced by Council Members Keith Powers, Shahana Hanif, and Carlina Rivera. These proposals include limiting detention on civil immigration holds, restricting communication between city agencies and ICE, and establishing a private right of action for individuals unlawfully detained. As a City Council Member, I will advocate for the expansion of legal protections and access to work authorization, increased financial aid opportunities for undocumented students, and robust support for grassroots organizations that provide critical services to immigrant communities. 11. How will you represent the most vulnerable, including individuals experiencing homelessness and asylum seekers? Have you ever opposed any shelter in your district? Currently in my career, I haven’t opposed any shelter in my district. However, I do believe that reform is needed in the proposition of shelter sites throughout the City and we have to take a strong stance in ending homelessness, while assisting asylum seekers. If elected, one of the first pieces of legislation I will introduce is a comprehensive Affordable Housing and Rent Stabilization Act. This initiative will focus on both immediate and long-term solutions to address our housing crisis—halting unreasonable rent hikes, strengthening rent control measures, holding landlords accountable for deceptive practices, and expediting rental assistance vouchers for individuals and families facing homelessness. This legislation will also support the construction of more deeply affordable housing units, with a higher percentage allocated specifically for individuals experiencing homelessness. A key component of this plan includes pushing for the immediate processing of rental assistance vouchers and advocating for the creation of a dedicated unit to ensure that qualified individuals and families can secure housing without delay. Additionally, we will work in close coordination with the Department of Social Services to ensure that landlords and housing providers are paid on time and feel supported in continuing to house vulnerable populations. We will also pursue legal action against those who discriminate against tenants"

As a City Council Member, I will organize and coordinate town halls to educate our constituents on what’s at stake and how laws and policies impact our communities and what are their rights, while using digital platforms to uplift and amplify underrepresented voices. Alongside my colleagues in government and advocacy organizations, we will craft and advance strong legislative policies to counter any actions from the Trump administration that threaten the progressive values of our city or promote unconstitutional and oppressive agendas. We will also continue to build a safer, more inclusive city, protecting working families and vulnerable individuals by strengthening community safety networks and advocating for sanctuary spaces in our community centers, churches, and neighborhoods. 8. Do you support the unrestricted right to reproductive care and abortion? I support the right to reproductive care and abortion, but not unrestricted under certain circumstances. 9. Have you hosted, funded or otherwise supported Drag Story Hours in your community? I have not hosted or provided funding for Drag Story Hours. However, I believe in creating safe and welcoming spaces for all members of our community, and I stand with efforts that celebrate diversity and foster understanding, for all members of our community. 10. What proposals will do you support to increase the protection of immigrants and cement New York City’s status as a Sanctuary City? To enhance protections for immigrants and reaffirm New York City's status as a Sanctuary City, I support key legislative and policy initiatives, including those introduced by Council Members Keith Powers, Shahana Hanif, and Carlina Rivera. These proposals include limiting detention on civil immigration holds, restricting communication between city agencies and ICE, and establishing a private right of action for individuals unlawfully detained. As a City Council Member, I will advocate for the expansion of legal protections and access to work authorization, increased financial aid opportunities for undocumented students, and robust support for grassroots organizations that provide critical services to immigrant communities. 11. How will you represent the most vulnerable, including individuals experiencing homelessness and asylum seekers? Have you ever opposed any shelter in your district? Currently in my career, I haven’t opposed any shelter in my district. However, I do believe that reform is needed in the proposition of shelter sites throughout the City and we have to take a strong stance in ending homelessness, while assisting asylum seekers. If elected, one of the first pieces of legislation I will introduce is a comprehensive Affordable Housing and Rent Stabilization Act. This initiative will focus on both immediate and long-term solutions to address our housing crisis—halting unreasonable rent hikes, strengthening rent control measures, holding landlords accountable for deceptive practices, and expediting rental assistance vouchers for individuals and families facing homelessness. This legislation will also support the construction of more deeply affordable housing units, with a higher percentage allocated specifically for individuals experiencing homelessness. A key component of this plan includes pushing for the immediate processing of rental assistance vouchers and advocating for the creation of a dedicated unit to ensure that qualified individuals and families can secure housing without delay. Additionally, we will work in close coordination with the Department of Social Services to ensure that landlords and housing providers are paid on time and feel supported in continuing to house vulnerable populations. We will also pursue legal action against those who discriminate against tenants"

Ortiz Office Seeking Election for: New York City Council District 17 Campaign Website: https://ortizforthebronx.com 1. Based upon your life experiences and accomplishments, why do you believe you are best qualified to represent your district? I am an Afro-Dominican, born in the Dominican Republic and raised in the South Bronx. A proud product of the public education system and a member of a family of educators, I have devoted my life to grassroots organizing and public service. Currently, I am the State Committeeman for the 85th NYS Assembly District and NYC Director of Constituent Services at the Office of the Comptroller. As Director of Constituent Services, I oversee the public interface operations across all five boroughs, assisting thousands of families each year with quality-of-life concerns and navigating government processes. However, I began my career as a Youth Counselor in the South Bronx and West Harlem, spearheading school-based initiatives designed to empower youth and connect families to essential community resources. I then transitioned to roles such as Office Manager for Assemblyman Marcos A. Crespo, Bronx Borough Liaison for former NYC Comptroller Scott M. Stringer and being an NYPD Auxiliary Police Officer, prior to my current incumbencies. My core values are rooted in community empowerment, equity and justice, education, and accountability. I am running because my life's work has been dedicated to helping people, and I am deeply committed to bringing strong, well-prepared leadership to our city. We need a voice that will unapologetically advocate for critical issues such as: building a safer community, ensuring affordable housing and homeownership for all, improving our educational system for youth,together with fostering innovative careers, job opportunities, and entrepreneurship for everyone. Our city deserves leadership that will tirelessly fight for these changes and will serve as a renewing hope 2. What LGBTQ organizations have you been involved with, either on a volunteer basis or professionally? What LGBTQ candidates have you endorsed? I have long supported leaders committed to equality, including backing candidates like Ritchie Torres at the start of his government career and when running for congress. Through my roles in public service, I’ve actively participated in community outreach events hosted by LGBTQ organizations, where I provided on-site constituent services to ensure our government remains accessible and responsive to all. 3. If you receive our endorsement, do you agree to identify the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club on all literature and electronic materials? Yes 4. What press conferences, demonstrations, rallies and protests in support of LGBT issues, pro-choice legislation, racial justice, criminal justice have you attended, including rallies specifically against Donald Trump? In my government roles, I have attended numerous rallies over the years, representing the elected officials I served at the time. Most recently, I marched alongside the Working Families Party during the Hands Off demonstration, continuing my commitment to advocacy and grassroots action. 5. In light of the upcoming Trump Administration’s war on women, the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities and immigrants, what are your plans to organize and combat the Trump agenda? In the face of the upcoming Trump administration’s attacks on women, the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities, and immigrants, we must organize with urgency and stand united with community leaders, grassroots organizations, and advocacy groups across our city. From defending reproductive rights and trans lives to protecting immigrants and communities of color, we will resist through direct action, mutual collaboration, and results-driven political engagement. As a City Council Member, I will organize and coordinate town halls to educate our constituents on what’s at stake and how laws and policies impact our communities and what are their rights, while using digital platforms to uplift and amplify underrepresented voices. Alongside my colleagues in government and advocacy organizations, we will craft and advance strong legislative policies to counter any actions from the Trump administration that threaten the progressive values of our city or promote unconstitutional and oppressive agendas. We will also continue to build a safer, more inclusive city, protecting working families and vulnerable individuals by strengthening community safety networks and advocating for sanctuary spaces in our community centers, churches, and neighborhoods. 6. Will you seek or accept endorsements of individuals who oppose LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights, such as Ruben Diaz Sr., Fernando Cabrera or Erick Salgado? Will you pledge to denounce their homophobia and anti-choice positions in the event you receive an endorsement from such individuals? Yes 7. In light of"

What proposals will do you support to increase the protection of immigrants and cement New York City’s status as a Sanctuary City? To enhance protections for immigrants and reaffirm New York City's status as a Sanctuary City, I support key legislative and policy initiatives, including those introduced by Council Members Keith Powers, Shahana Hanif, and Carlina Rivera. These proposals include limiting detention on civil immigration holds, restricting communication between city agencies and ICE, and establishing a private right of action for individuals unlawfully detained. As a City Council Member, I will advocate for the expansion of legal protections and access to work authorization, increased financial aid opportunities for undocumented students, and robust support for grassroots organizations that provide critical services to immigrant communities. 11. How will you represent the most vulnerable, including individuals experiencing homelessness and asylum seekers? Have you ever opposed any shelter in your district? Currently in my career, I haven’t opposed any shelter in my district. However, I do believe that reform is needed in the proposition of shelter sites throughout the City and we have to take a strong stance in ending homelessness, while assisting asylum seekers. If elected, one of the first pieces of legislation I will introduce is a comprehensive Affordable Housing and Rent Stabilization Act. This initiative will focus on both immediate and long-term solutions to address our housing crisis—halting unreasonable rent hikes, strengthening rent control measures, holding landlords accountable for deceptive practices, and expediting rental assistance vouchers for individuals and families facing homelessness. This legislation will also support the construction of more deeply affordable housing units, with a higher percentage allocated specifically for individuals experiencing homelessness. A key component of this plan includes pushing for the immediate processing of rental assistance vouchers and advocating for the creation of a dedicated unit to ensure that qualified individuals and families can secure housing without delay. Additionally, we will work in close coordination with the Department of Social Services to ensure that landlords and housing providers are paid on time and feel supported in continuing to house vulnerable populations. We will also pursue legal action against those who discriminate against tenants in need of housing. Our efforts will extend to working alongside the Department of Homeless Services to explore innovative ways to make temporary housing locations more welcoming. Creating environments that encourage individuals to seek out and accept services is essential to reducing barriers to stable housing. Through these coordinated efforts, I am committed to tackling homelessness head-on with long-term, sustainable solutions that provide safe, stable housing for all. By addressing these issues directly, we give every person a fair chance at a dignified life, strengthening our communities, creating lasting economic opportunities, reducing inequality, and ensuring we care for all, including asylum-seeking families. 12.

This initiative will focus on both immediate and long-term solutions to address our housing crisis—halting unreasonable rent hikes, strengthening rent control measures, holding landlords accountable for deceptive practices, and expediting rental assistance vouchers for individuals and families facing homelessness. This legislation will also support the construction of more deeply affordable housing units, with a higher percentage allocated specifically for individuals experiencing homelessness. A key component of this plan includes pushing for the immediate processing of rental assistance vouchers and advocating for the creation of a dedicated unit to ensure that qualified individuals and families can secure housing without delay. Additionally, we will work in close coordination with the Department of Social Services to ensure that landlords and housing providers are paid on time and feel supported in continuing to house vulnerable populations. We will also pursue legal action against those who discriminate against tenants in need of housing. Our efforts will extend to working alongside the Department of Homeless Services to explore innovative ways to make temporary housing locations more welcoming. Creating environments that encourage individuals to seek out and accept services is essential to reducing barriers to stable housing. Through these coordinated efforts, I am committed to tackling homelessness head-on with long-term, sustainable solutions that provide safe, stable housing for all. By addressing these issues directly, we give every person a fair chance at a dignified life, strengthening our communities, creating lasting economic opportunities, reducing inequality, and ensuring we care for all, including asylum-seeking families. 12.

    "text": "the upcoming Trump Administration’s war on women, the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities and immigrants, what are your plans to organize and combat the Trump agenda? In the face of the upcoming Trump administration’s attacks on women, the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities, and immigrants, we must organize with urgency and stand united with community leaders, grassroots organizations, and advocacy groups across our city. From defending reproductive rights and trans lives to protecting immigrants and communities of color, we will resist through direct action, mutual collaboration, and results-driven political engagement. As a City Council Member, I will organize and coordinate town halls to educate our constituents on what’s at stake and how laws and policies impact our communities and what are their rights, while using digital platforms to uplift and amplify underrepresented voices. Alongside my colleagues in government and advocacy organizations, we will craft and advance strong legislative policies to counter any actions from the Trump administration that threaten the progressive values of our city or promote unconstitutional and oppressive agendas. We will also continue to build a safer, more inclusive city, protecting working families and vulnerable individuals by strengthening community safety networks and advocating for sanctuary spaces in our community centers, churches, and neighborhoods. 8. Do you support the unrestricted right to reproductive care and abortion? I support the right to reproductive care and abortion, but not unrestricted under certain circumstances. 9. Have you hosted, funded or otherwise supported Drag Story Hours in your community? I have not hosted or provided funding for Drag Story Hours. However, I believe in creating safe and welcoming spaces for all members of our community, and I stand with efforts that celebrate diversity and foster understanding, for all members of our community. 10. What proposals will do you support to increase the protection of immigrants and cement New York City’s status as a Sanctuary City? To enhance protections for immigrants and reaffirm New York City's status as a Sanctuary City, I support key legislative and policy initiatives, including those introduced by Council Members Keith Powers, Shahana Hanif, and Carlina Rivera. These proposals include limiting detention on civil immigration holds, restricting communication between city agencies and ICE, and establishing a private right of action for individuals unlawfully detained. As a City Council Member, I will advocate for the expansion of legal protections and access to work authorization, increased financial aid opportunities for undocumented students, and robust support for grassroots organizations that provide critical services to immigrant communities. 11. How will you represent the most vulnerable, including individuals experiencing homelessness and asylum seekers? Have you ever opposed any shelter in your district? Currently in my career, I haven’t opposed any shelter in my district. However, I do believe that reform is needed in the proposition of shelter sites throughout the City and we have to take a strong stance in ending homelessness, while assisting asylum seekers. If elected, one of the first pieces of legislation I will introduce is a comprehensive Affordable Housing and Rent Stabilization Act.
