Read More Op-Ed | Universal swimming access in NYC will save lives On the most sweltering summer days in New York City, New Yorkers escape to the water. But for a city surrounded by water, a shocking number of New Yorkers can’t swim. And when they head to our pools and beaches to cool off every summer, the results can be tragic. Last summer, 19-year-old Amadou Thiam – home for summer break after his freshman year at Skidmore – drowned at Jacob Riis Park in the Rockaways. 15-year-old Markel Artis, a Bronx high schooler, drowned at Coney Island Beach. The list goes on. As Chair of the City Council’s Committee on Parks and Recreation, and as President and CEO of the YMCA of Greater New York and Co-Chair of the NYC Citywide Lifeguard & Aquatics Taskforce, we have seen firsthand the water safety challenges our city faces. Every year, we lose too many New Yorkers to drowning.

On Tuesday, a group gathered in Jackson Heights, Queens to make sure immigrants know their rights if ICE agents come knocking on their doors. “These are our most protected spaces because law enforcement cannot enter there without a judicial warrant,” said Natalie Alper of NY Immigration Coalition. Read More Krishnan tackles water safety issues Legislative package calls for pool atlas, longer beach season and more Councilmember Shekar Krishnan (D-Jackson Heights) last week introduced a legislative package designed to improve water safety across the city. The four-piece proposal includes Intro. 988, which would create a searchable map of city pools with detailed information on their hours and programs, and Intro. 275, which would lengthen the season for city pools and beaches and extend their hours of operation. (The latter bill was introduced earlier this year.) Read More Elmhurst Hospital gets a booster shot Elmhurst Hospital Center got a shot in the arm. And Frank D.

On Monday, just outside the main entrance to NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst, City Councilman Shekar Krishnan (D-Jackson Heights) and other top city and Queens officials announced major investments for the medical center and the Frank D. O’Connor Playground, which sits across the street. The hospital will get $6 million for a new infectious diseases clinic and $5 million toward improvements to the main entrance, as well as for a new cooling tower. The projects will likely enter the design phase next year, with construction estimated to commence in fall of 2023 and finish nine to 12 months later.

But last fall, delivery workers had already secured a wage hike — the first of its kind in the nation — that would have brought wages to $23.82 by 2025.

Public testimony centered on residents’ fears over mopeds, defined as small motorcycles or motorized scooters that go up to 40 miles per hour. They say mopeds are overrunning the bike lanes in 34th Avenue’s Paseo Park , where they are legally barred from entering.

The recently repaired Astoria Pool is only able to accommodate a third of its capacity due to a lifeguard deficit. Brighton Beach has red flags indicating no guard is on duty even at peak hours. Read More Op-Ed | Universal swimming access in NYC will save lives On the most sweltering summer days in New York City, New Yorkers escape to the water. But for a city surrounded by water, a shocking number of New Yorkers can’t swim. And when they head to our pools and beaches to cool off every summer, the results can be tragic. Last summer, 19-year-old Amadou Thiam – home for summer break after his freshman year at Skidmore – drowned at Jacob Riis Park in the Rockaways. 15-year-old Markel Artis, a Bronx high schooler, drowned at Coney Island Beach. The list goes on. As Chair of the City Council’s Committee on Parks and Recreation, and as President and CEO of the YMCA of Greater New York and Co-Chair of the NYC Citywide Lifeguard & Aquatics Taskforce, we have seen firsthand the water safety challenges our city faces. Every year, we lose too many New Yorkers to drowning.

As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Parks and Recreation, Shekar negotiated the highest budget ever for NYC Parks. He has approached access to parks and green space as a matter of social, racial, and immigrant justice. Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Woodside are home to thousands of essential workers—many of whom are immigrants—who carried this city forward during the pandemic and continue to keep our City running. Shekar has been a champion for them, fighting to: make our community affordable and safe, invest in Elmhurst Hospital and increase access to health care for all, make sure everyone can live in dignified housing, protect taxi workers, end the practice of solitary confinement at Rikers Island, and expand public green space for neighborhoods like our own that lack it. In his first terms, Shekar has made transformative investments in our health, our safety, and our public spaces, from a new surgery clinic at Elmhurst Hospital to safe play streets around schools and new playgrounds to Jackson Heights’ first public dog run. He has worked for our community across the board- launching a comprehensive 7 point plan to make Roosevelt Ave safer, making our Jackson Heights Post Office accessible, and fighting for our seniors healthcare and programs. Before his election to City Council, Shekar was a long-time community activist in Queens and a civil rights lawyer fighting housing discrimination. He co-founded the housing legal services organization Communities Resist. Shekar is the son of immigrants from South India who made enormous sacrifices and worked tirelessly to build a life for their family in this country. He is also a father of two young children and husband to Zoe, an immigration public defender and reproductive justice advocate. OUR FIGHT & OUR WINS Now is the time for bold, inclusive change which both roots out corruption in politics and puts power in the hands of the people, especially our workers, our immigrants, and our families. See our goals and what we’ve achieved. GO TO OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS PAGE Shekar has spent years fighting alongside our community as an advocate and parent. He has organized with his neighbors around a number of critical community initiatives, including: educating immigrant tenants on their housing rights; fighting for racial justice and dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline; coordinating the collection and delivery of PPE directly to the frontline workers at Elmhurst Hospital at the height of the pandemic; standing with the LGBTQIA+ community to root out hate and intolerance; advocating for safer streets for children and seniors; demanding far more public school funding; and mobilizing to protect and expand vital park space in Jackson Heights.

Members of the Campaign for Children (C4C) advocacy group were also in attendance and echoed Krishan’s call to the administration to address childcare needs and enrollment accessibility.
