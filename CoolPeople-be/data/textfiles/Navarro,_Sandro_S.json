Shane O’Brien Sandro Navarro , district director for State Sen. Jessica Ramos and one of six Democratic candidates seeking to replace term-limited Council Member Francisco Moya, has unveiled a platform focused on education, public space improvements, and housing protections as part of his campaign for City Council District 21. District 21 encompasses parts of Corona , East Elmhurst , LeFrak City , and Jackson Heights —areas undergoing rapid change while also facing long-standing quality-of-life issues. From military service to public advocacy Navarro, 36, is a U.S. Army veteran who served as a sergeant in Afghanistan. He said he discovered a passion for public service after returning to Queens in 2017, following nine years of active duty.

Critique of Roosevelt Avenue crackdown Navarro pointed to ongoing concerns along Roosevelt Avenue, where residents have voiced frustration over rising prostitution, organized crime, and sanitation issues. In response, Mayor Eric Adams and Council Member Moya launched Operation Restore Roosevelt , a 90-day, multi-agency enforcement plan targeting code violations and illegal activity. According to city officials, the initiative led to over 11,000 summonses and the shutdown of more than a dozen illegal brothels. Navarro, however, criticized the operation, arguing that it disproportionately targeted vulnerable community members—particularly street vendors and sex workers—without addressing the root causes of the problems. “A lot of street vendors… lost their property, lost their income.

District 21 encompasses parts of Corona , East Elmhurst , LeFrak City , and Jackson Heights —areas undergoing rapid change while also facing long-standing quality-of-life issues. From military service to public advocacy Navarro, 36, is a U.S. Army veteran who served as a sergeant in Afghanistan. He said he discovered a passion for public service after returning to Queens in 2017, following nine years of active duty. Born in Peru, Navarro later worked as a Queens neighborhood organizer with the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs under the de Blasio administration before becoming district director for Ramos.

Navarro has laid out three pillars of his campaign: expanding afterschool programming with a focus on STEM, improving cleanliness and safety in public spaces, and protecting local residents—particularly seniors—from displacement. Critique of Roosevelt Avenue crackdown Navarro pointed to ongoing concerns along Roosevelt Avenue, where residents have voiced frustration over rising prostitution, organized crime, and sanitation issues. In response, Mayor Eric Adams and Council Member Moya launched Operation Restore Roosevelt , a 90-day, multi-agency enforcement plan targeting code violations and illegal activity. According to city officials, the initiative led to over 11,000 summonses and the shutdown of more than a dozen illegal brothels. Navarro, however, criticized the operation, arguing that it disproportionately targeted vulnerable community members—particularly street vendors and sex workers—without addressing the root causes of the problems. “A lot of street vendors… lost their property, lost their income. These were people who were just trying to provide for their families,” Navarro said. “A lot of the sex workers were arrested. A"

That is the root of the problem.” He added that street vendors deserve access to legal protections. “The city could provide (street vendors) with a safety net… a process to do their job in a manner that is fair, not only for them, but for our neighbors too,” he said. “The problem is that the door to that system, and I’m talking about licensing, is closed for them.” Navarro is calling for the NYPD to stop issuing criminal fines to unlicensed vendors, advocating instead for civil penalties to reduce the risk of deportation for undocumented immigrants. He said efforts like Operation Restore Roosevelt made Roosevelt Avenue appear cleaner, but only because street vendors are now afraid to operate. To ensure lasting improvements, Navarro proposes increasing the Department of Sanitation’s budget to allow for more frequent garbage pick-ups and additional personnel. “They (District 21 residents) want to feel proud to live in our neighborhood, and I want them to feel proud,” he said. Immigrant protections and economic concerns Navarro, who immigrated to the U.S. at age 15, said many undocumented residents in the district are living in fear—particularly under the Trump administration’s immigration policies—which has had a chilling effect on the local economy. “They’re not going out as they used to go out,” Navarro said. “Our immigrant communities just want to be low-key—out of sight, out of mind.” He said that, if elected, he would advocate for expanded legal and financial support for immigrants facing deportation, including more funding for immigration nonprofits and efforts to reduce case backlogs among immigration attorneys. District 21 is also home to several major development projects, including the NYCFC stadium and housing plan in Willets Point, and the proposed $8 billion Metropolitan Park casino project near Citi Field, supported by Mets owner Steve Cohen and Hard Rock Entertainment. Navarro expressed concern about the casino’s impact on housing affordability but acknowledged broad community support for the project due to the promise of union jobs. Adding that he fears that the project, along with the Willets Point development, will drive up rents in the area and force out long-term residents. He said he would advocate for expanded access to right-to-counsel protections for tenants facing eviction, especially seniors. “We have many seniors going through eviction right now, and there are not enough housing lawyers,” Navarro said. “So the right to counsel is going to make sure that anybody that goes through either an immigration court or housing court… they get the funds that they need to make sure that they go with a lawyer.” Navarro, who owns a car, supports MTA funding but opposes the proposed $9 congestion pricing toll. Instead, he is proposing a “peak and plate” system—used in several South American countries—that limits vehicle usage based on license plate numbers during specific times. “It helps with congestion. It helps with traffic. It helps with pollution. Without charging them fees,” he said. Navarro also supports expanding bus service in East Elmhurst and introducing a ferry line connecting Flushing Bay to other parts of the city. “Our neighbors are not asking, they’re demanding more means of transportation,” he said. Navarro emphasized the need for increased investment in afterschool STEM programs, which he says can offer dual benefits by supporting children’s academic growth and helping working families with child care. District 21 saw parts of the electorate shift to the right in the last presidential election. Navarro attributed this, in part, to narratives around crime and a lack of effective outreach to Latino voters. “A good chunk didn’t vote, just didn’t care,” he said. “We have to change that. We have to let them know that we hear them, that we’re here to listen, that we’re here to be open about their needs and how we can make it better.” About the Author City Council candidate Sandro Navarro outlines priorities for District 21 seat By Shane O’Brien By Shane O’Brien Posted on March 26, 2025 Posted on Sandro Navarro , district director for State Sen.

He said efforts like Operation Restore Roosevelt made Roosevelt Avenue appear cleaner, but only because street vendors are now afraid to operate. To ensure lasting improvements, Navarro proposes increasing the Department of Sanitation’s budget to allow for more frequent garbage pick-ups and additional personnel. “They (District 21 residents) want to feel proud to live in our neighborhood, and I want them to feel proud,” he said. Immigrant protections and economic concerns Navarro, who immigrated to the U.S. at age 15, said many undocumented residents in the district are living in fear—particularly under the Trump administration’s immigration policies—which has had a chilling effect on the local economy. “They’re not going out as they used to go out,” Navarro said. “Our immigrant communities just want to be low-key—out of sight, out of mind.” He said that, if elected, he would advocate for expanded legal and financial support for immigrants facing deportation, including more funding for immigration nonprofits and efforts to reduce case backlogs among immigration attorneys. District 21 is also home to several major development projects, including the NYCFC stadium and housing plan in Willets Point, and the proposed $8 billion Metropolitan Park casino project near Citi Field, supported by Mets owner Steve Cohen and Hard Rock Entertainment. Navarro expressed concern about the casino’s impact on housing affordability but acknowledged broad community support for the project due to the promise of union jobs. Adding that he fears that the project, along with the Willets Point development, will drive up rents in the area and force out long-term residents. He said he would advocate for expanded access to right-to-counsel protections for tenants facing eviction, especially seniors. “We have many seniors going through eviction right now, and there are not enough housing lawyers,” Navarro said. “So the right to counsel is going to make sure that anybody that goes through either an immigration court or housing court… they get the funds that they need to make sure that they go with a lawyer.” Navarro, who owns a car, supports MTA funding but opposes the proposed $9 congestion pricing toll. Instead, he is proposing a “peak and plate” system—used in several South American countries—that limits vehicle usage based on license plate numbers during specific times. “It helps with congestion. It helps with traffic. It helps with pollution. Without charging them fees,” he said. Navarro also supports expanding bus service in East Elmhurst and introducing a ferry line connecting Flushing Bay to other parts of the city. “Our neighbors are not asking, they’re demanding more means of transportation,” he said. Navarro emphasized the need for increased investment in afterschool STEM programs, which he says can offer dual benefits by supporting children’s academic growth and helping working families with child care. District 21 saw parts of the electorate shift to the right in the last presidential election. Navarro attributed this, in part, to narratives around crime and a lack of effective outreach to Latino voters. “A good chunk didn’t vote, just didn’t care,” he said. “We have to change that. We have to let them know that we hear them, that we’re here to listen, that we’re here to be open about their needs and how we can make it better.” About the Author City Council candidate Sandro Navarro outlines priorities for District 21 seat By Shane O’Brien By Shane O’Brien Posted on March 26, 2025 Posted on Sandro Navarro , district director for State Sen.

To ensure lasting improvements, Navarro proposes increasing the Department of Sanitation’s budget to allow for more frequent garbage pick-ups and additional personnel. “They (District 21 residents) want to feel proud to live in our neighborhood, and I want them to feel proud,” he said. Immigrant protections and economic concerns Navarro, who immigrated to the U.S. at age 15, said many undocumented residents in the district are living in fear—particularly under the Trump administration’s immigration policies—which has had a chilling effect on the local economy. “They’re not going out as they used to go out,” Navarro said. “Our immigrant communities just want to be low-key—out of sight, out of mind.” He said that, if elected, he would advocate for expanded legal and financial support for immigrants facing deportation, including more funding for immigration nonprofits and efforts to reduce case backlogs among immigration attorneys. District 21 is also home to several major development projects, including the NYCFC stadium and housing plan in Willets Point, and the proposed $8 billion Metropolitan Park casino project near Citi Field, supported by Mets owner Steve Cohen and Hard Rock Entertainment. Navarro expressed concern about the casino’s impact on housing affordability but acknowledged broad community support for the project due to the promise of union jobs. Adding that he fears that the project, along with the Willets Point development, will drive up rents in the area and force out long-term residents. He said he would advocate for expanded access to right-to-counsel protections for tenants facing eviction, especially seniors. “We have many seniors going through eviction right now, and there are not enough housing lawyers,” Navarro said. “So the right to counsel is going to make sure that anybody that goes through either an immigration court or housing court… they get the funds that they need to make sure that they go with a lawyer.” Navarro, who owns a car, supports MTA funding but opposes the proposed $9 congestion pricing toll. Instead, he is proposing a “peak and plate” system—used in several South American countries—that"

Four Democratic candidates have officially filed to run for the seat so far. At least three are currently in Puerto Rico for this year’s Somos conference – and two are already backed by prominent lawmakers in the borough. State Sen. Jessica Ramos’ district director Sandro Stefano Navarro is running. As is Erycka Montoya, who works in intergovernmental affairs with the City Council speaker’s office, and has the support of progressive Assembly Members Catalina Cruz and Jessica González-Rojas. Also running is embattled former lawmaker and Moya rival Hiram Monserrate, who has been trying to mount a comeback since he pleaded guilty to corruption charges related to his previous tenure in the City Council. Nonprofit worker and district leader Yanna Henriquez rounds out the group of candidates with open campaign accounts. All hope to be the next person to represent Council District 21, which encompasses East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, LeFrak City and Corona. It’s unclear who Moya will end up backing for the seat. Asked by City & State Friday, he said “everyone who is running now, I will not be supporting.” Instead, he explained, he’ll endorse someone who has yet to enter the race. “That candidate will win,” Moya said, declining to specify who that person is. Several Queens operatives guessed that person might be Henriquez – chief program officer at Dominico-American Society of Queens. While she’s yet to formally launch a campaign, Henriquez recently opened an account with the campaign finance board. Like Moya, she’s a district leader for the Queens County Democratic Party and the two have known each other for years. Henriquez did not respond to a request for comment. Navarro, who currently lives in Jackson Heights, is an Army National Guard veteran who moved to New York from Peru as a teenager. Before he became Ramos’ district director, he worked for several years in the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs under former Mayor Bill de Blasio. Navarro credited his time in Ramos’ office and under the de Blasio administration for imbuing him with the ability to support the district’s heavily immigrant community – especially in wake of former President Donald Trump’s election.

As is Erycka Montoya, who works in intergovernmental affairs with the City Council speaker’s office, and has the support of progressive Assembly Members Catalina Cruz and Jessica González-Rojas. Also running is embattled former lawmaker and Moya rival Hiram Monserrate, who has been trying to mount a comeback since he pleaded guilty to corruption charges related to his previous tenure in the City Council. Nonprofit worker and district leader Yanna Henriquez rounds out the group of candidates with open campaign accounts. All hope to be the next person to represent Council District 21, which encompasses East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, LeFrak City and Corona. It’s unclear who Moya will end up backing for the seat. Asked by City & State Friday, he said “everyone who is running now, I will not be supporting.” Instead, he explained, he’ll endorse someone who has yet to enter the race. “That candidate will win,” Moya said, declining to specify who that person is. Several Queens operatives guessed that person might be Henriquez – chief program officer at Dominico-American Society of Queens. While she’s yet to formally launch a campaign, Henriquez recently opened an account with the campaign finance board. Like Moya, she’s a district leader for the Queens County Democratic Party and the two have known each other for years. Henriquez did not respond to a request for comment. Navarro, who currently lives in Jackson Heights, is an Army National Guard veteran who moved to New York from Peru as a teenager. Before he became Ramos’ district director, he worked for several years in the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs under former Mayor Bill de Blasio. Navarro credited his time in Ramos’ office and under the de Blasio administration for imbuing him with the ability to support the district’s heavily immigrant community – especially in wake of former President Donald Trump’s election.

With the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, he helped the city implement Covid-19 vaccination plans in the district. “I am very invested in my community and I think this is a great opportunity for me to tap into some of the resources that have been neglected to them,” Navarro told City & State of his decision to run. He described himself as a progressive. “That’s my politics – to be of service to the people that need the most resources at this moment,” he said.

This is far from the first time he has looked to mount a political comeback after he was booted from the state Senate in 2010 when he was charged with assault. (Later, he’d separately pled guilty to felony mail fraud charges.) While Monserrate most recently lost this summer in the Democratic primary for the 35th state Assembly district, he told City & State that he feels good about his chances. “The Council district compared to the Assembly district is apples and oranges in neighborhoods and makeup and landscape,” Monserrate said. It’s his old seat – he’d represented the district in the City Council from 2002 to 2008. And despite his recent string of losses, Monserrate, who currently lives in East Elmhurst, has remained entrenched in city politics. He was elected as a district leader in 2018 , holding the seat in the years since, and has been heavily involved in an ongoing campaign to fight crime on the Roosevelt Avenue Corridor. “I want to bring us back to a place where we have a safe community that everyone can enjoy. That’s kind of my main focus,” Monserrate said. Montoya, associate deputy director of Intergovernmental Affairs for the City Council speaker’s office, was born and raised in Corona by a single mother who migrated to the city from Colombia. While she too only recently launched her campaign, Montoya seems likely to mount a competitive race. Cruz and González-Rojas joined her kickoff event in early October and both have donated to her campaign. With about $11,000 in the bank, Montoya has raised the most so far, according to recent campaign finance filings. (Monserrate has raised nearly $8,000. Sandro and Henriquez are just getting started.) “We are seeing now the ramifications of decades of disinvestment in our community – a community that was already struggling but then devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Montoya said. “We have long been ignored, long been overlooked, long been stolen from and underrepresented.

Since then, he’s spent his life giving back to the borough that shaped him and is now home to his son. After graduating from Richmond Hill High School, Sandro enlisted in the U.S. Army National Guard, where he served two Deployments in Afghanistan and Kuwait and earned numerous military awards for his outstanding work. When he returned, Sandro attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice, where he earned his degree and served in the reserves. His experience brought him to the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA) under the DeBlasio administration, where he stepped up for his community and organized the first Peruvian Town Hall and then the first Andean Summit, which connected over 1,000 community members to essential city and state resources. He also led the charge to make Quechua a recognized indigenous language by the NYC municipal government. As the current District Director for State Senator Jessica Ramos, Sandro has become even more of a staple of our community. From raising the COVID vaccination rate from 24% to 91% of the population in Queens to connecting families to federal relief funds and emergency housing during Hurricane Ida – Sandro is always there and willing to help.
