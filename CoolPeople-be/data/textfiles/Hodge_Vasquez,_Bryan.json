Too often, crime goes unreported because people don’t believe they are protected, and Bryan is determined to change that. His plan focuses on both immediate action and long-term strategies to ensure safer streets now and for future generations. Increasing Police Presence to Deter Crime. Bryan is clear: The West Bronx needs more policing to immediately reduce and deter crime. He will advocate for an increased and visible police presence in areas with high crime rates to address immediate safety concerns . Bryan’s goal is to create a lasting sense of security by ensuring there are enough officers on the streets to prevent crime before it happens. At the same time, he will work to ensure that this increase in policing is paired with community engagement, better training, and accountability, so that law enforcement is seen as a partner in building safer neighborhoods. Addressing Small Crimes to Prevent Major Decline. Bryan understands that when small crimes go unchecked, they create the conditions for more serious offenses to thrive. Over the years, laws were made that limited the ability of courts to fully address these smaller crimes, leading to the very safety concerns we see in our community today. Bryan’s legal education and experience have shown him the value of maintaining strong judicial discretion to effectively combat crime at all levels. While previous leadership prioritized different approaches, these choices have contributed to the challenges we now face. Bryan is committed to reversing this trend by advocating for policies that give courts the tools they need to deal with crime comprehensively , ensuring that the West Bronx becomes a safer place where even the smallest offenses are addressed before they escalate. Community-Driven Crime Prevention That Lasts. Bryan’s approach to crime prevention is about more than just reacting to incidents—it’s about preventing them from happening in the first place. He will prioritize long-term investments in violence prevention programs that work, focusing on community-led initiatives and proven strategies that interrupt cycles of violence before they escalate. By expanding local violence interruption programs and integrating mental health resources, Bryan aims to create a sustainable model for public safety, one that protects the community today and reduces crime for future generations. Youth Engagement and Diversion Programs. At the heart of Bryan's vision is a strong belief in the potential of our youth. By introducing comprehensive mentorship and after-school programs, coupled with career training and educational opportunities, we're investing in a brighter future. These programs aren't just about keeping kids off the streets; they're about opening doors to new possibilities and guiding our young people towards a path of success and community leadership.
