Now, he is running to represent our community on the New York City Council. Erik believes that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead. Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His journey from a childhood in a remote area to a life of activism in New York City was profiled in a 2015 feature story cover story in the Adirondack Daily Enterprise titled “ Erik Bottcher’s Fight for Equality .” Erik's career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison at the New York City Council, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including transgender rights, hate crimes, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. He helped develop groundbreaking initiatives against bullying in New York City public schools and to break down stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2011, Erik was hired to help lead the fight for marriage equality in New York State by newly elected Governor Cuomo. As the Governor’s LGBTQ Community Liaison, Erik organized activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. That June, New York State made history as the largest state to permit same sex marriage. In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Since then, he has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more. When Hartley House, the 115 year-old settlement house in Hell’s Kitchen, was threatened with closure, Erik worked with community leaders to come up with a plan to prevent its sale to private developers. When our State’s rent stabilization laws were being held up in Albany, Erik was arrested alongside tenant activists for blocking the entryway to the Governor's office. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik took action, building an expansive volunteer network that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments . Additionally, he holds weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen. Erik’s effective leadership style is reflected in these and countless other examples, as well as in the deep support his candidacy has received from hundreds of community leaders across Council District 3, organized labor, elected officials, tenant groups, healthcare groups, and more . As a longtime member of the Village Independent Democrats and a co-founder of United Thru Action, a resistance group created in the days following the 2016 presidential election, Erik has been a fierce fighter for progressive values in electoral politics. He helped organize dozens of buses of volunteers that traveled to swing districts in Pennsylvania and beyond during the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, and was active in the fight to defeat the I.D.C. , which gave Democrats true control over the New York State Senate. This year, on top of his own campaign for City Council, Erik organized weekly phone banks for 17 weeks to help ensure the defeat of the most dangerous president in American history. Over 1,000 volunteers participated, making thousands of phone calls to voters in swing states. Times of crisis call for proven leadership, and the COVID-19 crisis has put New York City’s survival on the line. As our Council Member, Erik will create affordable housing and work to end homelessness fight for safe, livable and vibrant neighborhoods help our small businesses reopen safely and succeed work to root out the systemic racism that pervades society, including our criminal justice system advocate for our children and world-class public schools push for safer streets and better transportation options Erik is a graduate of The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. and was a Bohnett Leaders Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Senior Executives in State and Local Government program.

Erik believes that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead. Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His journey from a childhood in a remote area to a life of activism in New York City was profiled in a 2015 feature story cover story in the Adirondack Daily Enterprise titled “ Erik Bottcher’s Fight for Equality .” Erik's career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison at the New York City Council, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including transgender rights, hate crimes, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. He helped develop groundbreaking initiatives against bullying in New York City public schools and to break down stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2011, Erik was hired to help lead the fight for marriage equality in New York State by newly elected Governor Cuomo. As the Governor’s LGBTQ Community Liaison, Erik organized activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. That June, New York State made history as the largest state to permit same sex marriage. In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Since then, he has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more. When Hartley House, the 115 year-old settlement house in Hell’s Kitchen, was threatened with closure, Erik worked with community leaders to come up with a plan to prevent its sale to private developers. When our State’s rent stabilization laws were being held up in Albany, Erik was arrested alongside tenant activists for blocking the entryway to the Governor's office. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik took action, building an expansive volunteer network that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments . Additionally, he holds weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen. Erik’s effective leadership style is reflected in these and countless other examples, as well as in the deep support his candidacy has received from hundreds of community leaders across Council District 3, organized labor, elected officials, tenant groups, healthcare groups, and more . As a longtime member of the Village Independent Democrats and a co-founder of United Thru Action, a resistance group created in the days following the 2016 presidential election, Erik has been a fierce fighter for progressive values in electoral politics. He helped organize dozens of buses of volunteers that traveled to swing districts in Pennsylvania and beyond during the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, and was active in the fight to defeat the I.D.C. , which gave Democrats true control over the New York State Senate. This year, on top of his own campaign for City Council, Erik organized weekly phone banks for 17 weeks to help ensure the defeat of the most dangerous president in American history.

Erik believes that if we come together and rise to this moment, New York City’s best days are still ahead. Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His journey from a childhood in a remote area to a life of activism in New York City was profiled in a 2015 feature story cover story in the Adirondack Daily Enterprise titled “ Erik Bottcher’s Fight for Equality .” Erik's career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison at the New York City Council, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including transgender rights, hate crimes, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. He helped develop groundbreaking initiatives against bullying in New York City public schools and to break down stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2011, Erik was hired to help lead the fight for marriage equality in New York State by newly elected Governor Cuomo. As the Governor’s LGBTQ Community Liaison, Erik organized activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. That June, New York State made history as the largest state to permit same sex marriage. In 2015, Erik joined the team of New York City Council Member Corey Johnson as his Chief of Staff. Since then, he has worked tirelessly for the residents of Council District 3, fighting for more green space, better schools, affordable housing, senior services, and more. When Hartley House, the 115 year-old settlement house in Hell’s Kitchen, was threatened with closure, Erik worked with community leaders to come up with a plan to prevent its sale to private developers. When our State’s rent stabilization laws were being held up in Albany, Erik was arrested alongside tenant activists for blocking the entryway to the Governor's office. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Erik took action, building an expansive volunteer network that made weekly wellness calls to thousands of home-bound seniors and delivered tens of thousands of meals to food insecure residents across the district. He created a vaccine volunteer program that helped nearly 400 seniors get vaccination appointments . Additionally, he holds weekly community cleanups in the Village, Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen.

In 2021, he was elected to represent New York City Council District 3, which includes the neighborhoods of the West Village, Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, Times Square, Hudson Square, Flatiron, and the Garment District. He sees his mission as simple yet vital: making New York City a better place to live. Growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains as the only gay person he knew, Erik’s personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison in the City Council’s community outreach unit, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including hate crimes, transgender rights, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaison in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage. From 2015 to 2021, Erik served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor, Council Member Corey Johnson. In this role he gained an encyclopedic knowledge of every block of Council District 3 while providing constituent services to tens of thousands of residents and working alongside tenant associations, block associations, community boards, PTAs, parks groups and others to make our community a better place to live. Erik has established a citywide reputation as one of the most active and effective members of the New York City Council, leading on critical issues such as the crises of mental health, housing, sanitation, sustainability, and more. He is working to reverse decades of failed policies and disinvestment in mental healthcare, authoring and passing landmark legislation that requires family homeless shelters to provide on-site mental health services, requiring the Department of Education to provide suicide prevention resources to students, fighting for adequate inpatient psychiatric treatment capacity, and more. Recognizing the importance of clean and healthy neighborhoods, Erik has been at the forefront of sanitation improvement efforts in the city, leading the way on reforms such as the containerization of garbage, reduced usage of single-use plastics, increased corner basket service, and other initiatives to enhance the city’s cleanliness. Few elected officials have been more vocal than Erik about the affordable housing crisis that poses an existential threat to New York City. With the lowest rental apartment vacancy rate since 1968 and the highest levels of homelessness since the Great Depression, Erik believes that an abundance of housing is needed to bring down housing costs. He has worked with his local community boards to create a pipeline of thousands of affordable housing units in Council District 3. Environmental sustainability is also a key priority for Erik. He has funded the planting of hundreds of new street trees in Council District 3. His legislation creating the Urban Forest Master Plan aims to increase the tree canopy coverage to 30% by 2030. He has championed universal curbside composting, renovated parks and playgrounds, waged war against single-use plastics, and promoted cycling as a form of transportation by creating new protected bike lanes on Tenth Avenue and Lower Sixth Avenue. Erik is Co-Chair of the Council’s Manhattan Delegation and the LGBTQIA+ Caucus. He serves on the following City Council committees: Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addition; Public Housing; Small Business; Technology; Economic Development; Civil Service and Labor; Contracts; Higher Education; and Immigration.

Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaison in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage. From 2015 to 2021, Erik served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor, Council Member Corey Johnson. In this role he gained an encyclopedic knowledge of every block of Council District 3 while providing constituent services to tens of thousands of residents and working alongside tenant associations, block associations, community boards, PTAs, parks groups and others to make our community a better place to live. Erik has established a citywide reputation as one of the most active and effective members of the New York City Council, leading on critical issues such as the crises of mental health, housing, sanitation, sustainability, and more. He is working to reverse decades of failed policies and disinvestment in mental healthcare, authoring and passing landmark legislation that requires family homeless shelters to provide on-site mental health services, requiring the Department of Education to provide suicide prevention resources to students, fighting for adequate inpatient psychiatric treatment capacity, and more. Recognizing the importance of clean and healthy neighborhoods, Erik has been at the forefront of sanitation improvement efforts in the city, leading the way on reforms such as the containerization of garbage, reduced usage of single-use plastics, increased corner basket service, and other initiatives to enhance the city’s cleanliness. Few elected officials have been more vocal than Erik about the affordable housing crisis that poses an existential threat to New York City. With the lowest rental apartment vacancy rate since 1968 and the highest levels of homelessness since the Great Depression, Erik believes that an abundance of housing is needed to bring down housing costs. He has worked with his local community boards to create a pipeline of thousands of affordable housing units in Council District 3. Environmental sustainability is also a key priority for Erik. He has funded the planting of hundreds of new street trees in Council District 3. His legislation creating the Urban Forest Master Plan aims to increase the tree canopy coverage to 30% by 2030. He has championed universal curbside composting, renovated parks and playgrounds, waged war against single-use plastics, and promoted cycling as a form of transportation by creating new protected bike lanes on Tenth Avenue and Lower Sixth Avenue. Erik is Co-Chair of the Council’s Manhattan Delegation and the LGBTQIA+ Caucus. He serves on the following City Council committees: Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addition; Public Housing; Small Business; Technology; Economic Development; Civil Service and Labor; Contracts; Higher Education; and Immigration.

    "text": "personal struggles with depression sparked in him a lifelong dedication to helping the most marginalized members of our society. His career in public service began in 2009 as the LGBTQ & HIV/AIDS Community Liaison in the City Council’s community outreach unit, where he organized grassroots campaigns on issues including hate crimes, transgender rights, housing for people with HIV/AIDS, and marriage equality. Erik then served as the statewide LGBTQ Community Liaison in the governor’s office, where he helped organize the fight for marriage equality in New York State, working with activists from Buffalo to Montauk in an unprecedented grassroots campaign to garner support for the Marriage Equality Act. New York State made history as the largest state to legalize same sex marriage. From 2015 to 2021, Erik served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor, Council Member Corey Johnson. In this role he gained an encyclopedic knowledge of every block of Council District 3 while providing constituent services to tens of thousands of residents and working alongside tenant associations, block associations, community boards, PTAs, parks groups and others to make our community a better place to live. Erik has established a citywide reputation as one of the most active and effective members of the New York City Council, leading on critical issues such as the crises of mental health, housing, sanitation, sustainability, and more. He is working to reverse decades of failed policies and disinvestment in mental healthcare, authoring and passing landmark legislation that requires family homeless shelters to provide on-site mental health services, requiring the Department of Education to provide suicide prevention resources to students, fighting for adequate inpatient psychiatric treatment capacity, and more. Recognizing the importance of clean and healthy neighborhoods, Erik has been at the forefront of sanitation improvement efforts in the city, leading the way on reforms such as the containerization of garbage, reduced usage of single-use plastics, increased corner basket service, and other initiatives to enhance the city’s cleanliness. Few elected officials have been more vocal than Erik about the affordable housing crisis that poses an existential threat to New York City. With the lowest rental apartment vacancy rate since 1968 and the highest levels of homelessness since the Great Depression, Erik believes that an abundance of housing is needed to bring down housing costs. He has worked with his local community boards to create a pipeline of thousands of affordable housing units in Council District 3. Environmental sustainability is also a key priority for Erik. He has funded the planting of hundreds of new street trees in Council District 3. His legislation creating the Urban Forest Master Plan aims to increase the tree canopy coverage to 30% by 2030. He has championed universal curbside composting, renovated parks and playgrounds, waged war against single-use plastics, and promoted cycling as a form of transportation by creating new protected bike lanes on Tenth Avenue and Lower Sixth Avenue. Erik is Co-Chair of the Council’s Manhattan Delegation and the LGBTQIA+ Caucus. He serves on the following City Council committees: Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addition; Public Housing; Small Business; Technology; Economic Development; Civil Service and Labor; Contracts; Higher Education; and Immigration.

    "text": "0 0 Open Menu Close Menu Open Menu Close Menu Dear Friends: I’m running for City Council to ensure an economic recovery that benefits all New Yorkers, not just those who were doing well before this crisis. If elected, I will work with local partners to create a West Side Employment Network that will connect residents with job opportunities in Council District 3. Recent years have seen the arrival of many large employers in our district, from Google to Spotify to Coach. More are on the way, such as Disney. There are hundreds of smaller employers in our community, from hospitality to culture to retail. We need growth and economic development, but we must ensure that growth benefits everyone, including the residents of our local public housing developments and those living near or below the poverty line. For too long, many New Yorkers have been left behind. That must change, and a West Side Employment Network will help us lift up everyone and help make a brighter future for all. Thank you, Erik The West Side Employment Network The West Side Employment Network will help ensure that employers in Council District 3 are hiring locally. It will match local jobseekers with employment opportunities in our district, and help prepare jobseekers to obtain and thrive in those jobs. As a member of the City Council, I will work with local partners to create this network and ensure that it has the funding and staffing to succeed. The West Side Employment Network will have four key features: A ‘resume bank’ of local residents seeking employment Companies in our district may want to hire local talent, but they don’t always know where to start. We can make this process simpler by developing a listing of local residents who are ready, willing and able to work. This will be an asset to local employers who are in need of talent, and it will be a place for local job seekers to submit their resumes. A ‘jobs bank’ of employment opportunities at local employers There are many job opportunities locally, but residents frequently don’t have access to them. Companies that participate in the West Side Employment Network will make job listings available, with criteria to assist in job placement. This network will assist us in asking companies to meet local hiring goals. Additionally, apprenticeship and career opportunities via unions and construction trades could be made available via the West Side Employment Network. Staff to match job local seekers with local jobs Staff and volunteers will help match job seekers with jobs. Pre-interview assessments will help job seekers identify job opportunities that are the best fit for them. To perform these crucial functions, the network will require resources and staffing. Programs to prepare job seekers to apply for and keep jobs Just as it is important to provide jobseekers with opportunities, it is important that they have the tools to obtain those jobs and thrive in them. The West Side Employment Network will provide local residents with access to resume writing assistance, interview preparation, and skills training. Organizations such as Nontraditional Employment for Women could be partners in these efforts. Local employers can also make training opportunities available to local residents. This ‘employment network’ model has been used successfully elsewhere. The program could be administered by a local non-profit organization such as Hudson Guild, which is co-located with the NYCHA Elliott-Chelsea Houses and Fulton Houses, supported by a coalition of public and private partners. ### Dear Friends: I’m running for City Council to ensure an economic recovery that benefits all New Yorkers, not just those who were doing well before this crisis.

Difficult as the experience was, the 30 days of care that I received at Four Winds Hospital saved my life. It wasn’t until years later that I realized how privileged I was. Most Americans do not have sufficient access to behavioral health care, especially BIPOC Americans, undocumented people, and those living in poverty. It has been said that we are currently living through two pandemics: the COVID-19 pandemic, and the “shadow pandemic” of mental illness. As a country, we have failed in our approach to mental health. Our most tragic failure relates to those with serious mental illness. One need look no further than the streets of any large city in America, including New York City. Thousands of our fellow New Yorkers are experiencing unfathomable pain and suffering, right before our eyes. Many of the tragedies that have happened were entirely avoidable with proper care and treatment. The seeds of this crisis were sown decades ago, when the faulty system of institutionalized mental health care was dismantled and people who had been warehoused in large, inhumane facilities were moved out of those facilities, most of which were subsequently closed. That system was supposed to have been replaced with a comprehensive system of community-based outpatient care and services. That hasn’t happened. Today, the largest providers of mental health services in the United States are prisons and jails. This issue is personal for me. It is time for our government to take concrete action to help people with mental illness. Below are just a few of the steps that we must take. I know it is possible to achieve a society that cares for its most vulnerable and ensures the health and safety of all. As a member of the New York City Council, I will take on this fight. In service, Erik Bottcher 1. Stop the Closure of Inpatient Psychiatric Beds According to the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA) , the number of certified inpatient psychiatric beds in New York State dropped 12% between 2000 and 2018, at the same time as the population and the need have mushroomed. New York City accounts for 72% of the decline in inpatient psychiatric beds between 2000 and 2019, a total loss of 459 beds. This loss of clinical space hasn’t been replaced by community-based services. Instead, patients have been funneled into the carceral system and shelter system. New York State needs to stop the decertification of inpatient psychiatric beds. Any closures of beds must be accompanied by an increase in quality services elsewhere that can serve this vulnerable population. Additionally, there must be an infusion of funding for comprehensive hospital discharge planning, which is currently inadequate. 2. Immediately Dispatch Mobile Mental Health Crisis Response Teams on the West Side In November, Mayor de Blasio announced a pilot program in which health professionals and crisis workers would be dispatched to respond to mental health crises. That program is being piloted in Northern Manhattan beginning this spring. Unfortunately, we do not have time to wait for a lengthy pilot program to be completed before expanding this program. There is an immediate need for these response teams citywide. This program should be accelerated and expanded to other neighborhoods, including those in Council District 3. People experiencing mental health emergencies need to be stabilized, treated and connected to appropriate wrap around services. For too long, armed police officers have been the default first responders to mental health crises, and this must change. 3. Increase Crisis Stabilization Centers When unhoused New Yorkers experiencing mental health crises are brought to the hospital, they are released after they are medically stabilized. Frequently, they are not sick enough to stay in the hospital, but are too sick to return to a shelter or the streets. Crisis stabilization centers, also known as medical respite beds, fill this critical need, giving people time and space to recuperate. This provides a critical opportunity to connect them with social services. Unfortunately, there are far too few crisis stabilization centers available in New York City. Therefore, many people experiencing mental health crises are taken to the hospital in ambulances, only to be discharged back to the streets hours later. New York City must expand its medical respite program significantly in all five boroughs. 4. Build"

Frequently, they are not sick enough to stay in the hospital, but are too sick to return to a shelter or the streets.

This provides a critical opportunity to connect them with social services. Unfortunately, there are far too few crisis stabilization centers available in New York City.

Stop the Closure of Inpatient Psychiatric Beds According to the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA) , the number of certified inpatient psychiatric beds in New York State dropped 12% between 2000 and 2018, at the same time as the population and the need have mushroomed. New York City accounts for 72% of the decline in inpatient psychiatric beds between 2000 and 2019, a total loss of 459 beds. This loss of clinical space hasn’t been replaced by community-based services. Instead, patients have been funneled into the carceral system and shelter system.

Unfortunately, New York City has only constructed a fraction of the supportive housing that is needed to meet the growing demand. We must create quality supportive housing in all five boroughs, and this should include the conversion of distressed commercial properties. 5. Embrace and Expand the “Clubhouse Model” of Psychosocial Rehabilitation The Clubhouse Model, created decades ago by Hell’s Kitchen’s own Fountain House and now used internationally, is a community-based service model that helps people with a history of serious mental illness rejoin society and maintain their place in it. Clubhouses are community centers where people with mental illness can find opportunities for friendship, employment, housing, education and access to medical and psychiatric services in a caring and safe environment. This model is also effective for helping people released from congregate care settings rejoin society and sustain a healthier life within the community. Clubhouse members experience significantly lower rates of hospitalization, incarceration, and suicide compared to others with serious mental illness. Unfortunately, the current need far exceeds the capacity of Fountain House and other Clubhouses. New York City should immediately begin facilitating the creation of at least 10 more Clubhouse locations, distributed across the five boroughs. Clubhouses are sometimes co-located with supportive housing. 6. Revamp Discharge Planning & Services for Formerly Incarcerated New Yorkers - Expand The Fortune Society Model Thousands of people with serious mental illness have been funneled into the carceral system because of society’s failure to provide adequate behavioral health treatment. Upon release, individuals are discharged with inadequate planning and support services. Those without homes to go to are often released directly into the New York City shelter system, with inadequate case management and few prospects for housing, employment, substance use treatment, and mental health care. The State should enact A.6458 (Weprin) and S.2792 (Sepulveda) , which would require the state to assist people in obtaining housing prior to release from a correctional institution. The bill would also obligate the state to reimburse local social services districts, such as New York City, for each discharge to temporary shelter in that district. These funds could be used to ensure proper supportive services, like behavioral health care. The Fortune Society and The Osborne Association are examples of community based organizations that work with formerly incarcerated individuals to help them thrive. The city, state, and federal governments should invest more in these programs and help them procure brick-and-mortar transitional housing that will serve as alternatives to the shelter system. 7. Increase School Based Behavioral Health Serious mental illness often begins to take shape in adolescence. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical, which is why school-based health and social services are essential. At a minimum, schools must have nurses, counselors and social workers on site who are trained to identify warning signs of behavioral health issues and make referrals to behavioral health professionals. The recently passed New York State budget appropriated $37.8 billion in long overdue funding for public schools in New York State, and a portion of this funding should be used for school based counseling and health services. 8. Redirect ThriveNYC Funds to Address Serious Mental Illness As of 2019, roughly 10 percent of ThriveNYC’s $250 million annual budget was spent on serving those with serious mental illness. Although City Hall has said it would begin diverting more funding to this purpose, hundreds of millions of dollars that could have been spent addressing this issue in recent years were not. This was a big missed opportunity. While some effective programs have been brought under the ThriveNYC umbrella, an overall shift in priorities is needed to address this crisis.

The State should enact A.6458 (Weprin) and S.2792 (Sepulveda) , which would require the state to assist people in obtaining housing prior to release from a correctional institution.

Stop the Closure of Inpatient Psychiatric Beds According to the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA) , the number of certified inpatient psychiatric beds in New York State dropped 12% between 2000 and 2018, at the same time as the population and the need have mushroomed. New York City accounts for 72% of the decline in inpatient psychiatric beds between 2000 and 2019, a total loss of 459 beds. This loss of clinical space hasn’t been replaced by community-based services. Instead, patients have been funneled into the carceral system and shelter system. New York State needs to stop the decertification of inpatient psychiatric beds.

That program is being piloted in Northern Manhattan beginning this spring. Unfortunately, we do not have time to wait for a lengthy pilot program to be completed before expanding this program. There is an immediate need for these response teams citywide. This program should be accelerated and expanded to other neighborhoods, including those in Council District 3. People experiencing mental health emergencies need to be stabilized, treated and connected to appropriate wrap around services. For too long, armed police officers have been the default first responders to mental health crises, and this must change. announced 3.

Frequently, they are not sick enough to stay in the hospital, but are too sick to return to a shelter or the streets. Crisis stabilization centers, also known as medical respite beds, fill this critical need, giving people time and space to recuperate. This provides a critical opportunity to connect them with social services. Unfortunately, there are far too few crisis stabilization centers available in New York City. Therefore, many people experiencing mental health crises are taken to the hospital in ambulances, only to be discharged back to the streets hours later.

I’m proud to present “Clean District 3,” my vision for sanitation in our community.

Picking up the trash and keeping our neighborhoods clean is a fundamental responsibility of city government. Let’s face it: even before the COVID-19 crisis, New York City was falling short on sanitation and our sustainability policies were stuck in the past. Below you’ll find details of the plan. I’m excited to make this vision a reality as a member of the New York City Council. Yours always, Erik Bottcher The ‘Clean District 3’ Sanitation Plan Increase Corner Basket Pickup As a member of the City Council, I will fight for a significant increase in corner basket service. Last year, in order to close the budget gap, the Department of Sanitation’s budget was slashed by $106 million. Weekly litter basket runs were cut by 63 percent—from 736 to 272. Sunday basket service was eliminated entirely. Some service was restored, but not in Council District 3. We need a full restoration of basket service, and an increase over time, because overflowing waste baskets were a chronic problem even before the COVID-19 crisis. Increase & Improve Street Cleaning Street cleaning needs to be restored to two days a week. It was reduced to once a week in June of 2020 by Mayor de Blasio, resulting in trash accumulation on side streets, alongside parked cars and in gutters. I will also push for the purchase of smaller street sweepers that are able to properly clean narrow bike lanes. Many bike lanes are too narrow for full-size street sweepers, and they frequently accumulate trash. The Hudson River Park Trust uses small street sweepers to clean the West Side Bikeway, and we need them for bike lanes throughout Council District 3. Create Borough-wide DSNY ‘Strike Teams’ that Respond to 311 Calls in Real Time I am proposing the creation of ‘strike teams’ of sanitation workers who are assigned to cover each borough, responding in real-time to 311 complaints of overflowing waste baskets and other unsanitary conditions. This would help prevent sanitation issues from going unresolved for long periods of time, which compromises quality of life, public health and rodent control. Use On-Street Containers, Not Sidewalks, for Garbage Collection On trash collection days, New Yorkers are currently forced to walk by mountains of trash bags that take up valuable sidewalk space. It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of piling bags on the sidewalk in front of each building for collection, the city should allow residential communities to use on-street containers or corrals in centralized locations on each block, like they do in parts of Buenos Aires and Barcelona . This concept is currently being piloted by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Sanitation in Business Improvement Districts primarily, but it should be expanded to more neighborhoods immediately and give New Yorkers relief from congested and unsanitary sidewalks.

Here in Council District 3, in the short term, a pneumatic tube should be installed underneath the High Line that could transfer garbage from up and down the West Side to centralized collection locations, reducing truck traffic on our streets and becoming a model that could be used elsewhere. This proposal has already garnered support from local stakeholders and I will push to make it a reality. Additionally, I will support installing this technology at large complexes such as NYCHA and Penn South. New Litter Baskets The standard wire waste bins currently found on the corners throughout New York City are antiquated, frequently in disrepair, and overflow quickly. I will fund the replacement of these wire baskets with new and modern high capacity bins at intersections throughout Council District 3. Universal Organic Waste Collection It’s time to mandate universal composting services for all residents and businesses. The State of California did so a year ago, and I will sponsor City Council legislation to make this happen in New York City. Additionally, the city should use organic waste to generate clean energy locally, which could be done at a new green energy hub on Rikers Island. A mandatory organic waste program could divert more than 1 million tons of garbage from landfills each year , reducing carbon emissions, preventing rodent infestation, and improving sidewalk conditions on trash collection days. New York City’s waste alone is responsible for 1.7 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year, primarily due to food waste. As District 3 Chief of Staff in Speaker Corey Johnson’s office, I helped substantially increase organic waste programs in Council District 3, including facilitating the adoption of curbside pickup at Westbeth, Penn South and Manhattan Plaza and new drop-off locations throughout the district. Better Regulate Corner Newspaper Boxes Corner newspaper boxes are often filthy, covered with graffiti and stickers, broken, and filled with litter. I will fight for stricter standards with respect to design, placement, and maintenance of newspaper/magazine dispensers. If elected, I will co-sponsor legislation similar to that introduced by Council Member Danny Dromm. Ban More Single Use Plastics Plastic waste is killing our marine ecosystem and littering our neighborhoods. I will fight for the phasing out of single-use plastics in New York City, including plastic straws, stir sticks, and single-use water bottles. The NYC Department of Sanitation collected roughly 36 million pounds of single-use plastics from homes each year across the five boroughs in 2017. The department estimates that commercial establishments contribute tens of million more pounds to that number. To help reduce our reliance on single-use water bottles, we should pilot reusable water bottle refilling stations at fire hydrants, and they did in Montreal . While banning plastic bags and polystyrene foam were positive steps, we need to go much further if we are to save our ecosystem. A More Accurate Sanitation Scorecard The Mayor’s Office of Operations issues Street & Sidewalk Cleanliness Ratings , but the process is opaque and the cleanliness scores don’t always correspond to conditions on the ground. For example, 94.1 percent of streets in Community Board 2, 88.9 percent of streets in Community Board 4, and 93.7 percent of streets in Community Board 5 were rated “acceptably clean” in the November 2020 monthly report . All four of these Community Boards were given a 100 percent sidewalk cleanliness rating for quarter 2 of Fiscal Year 2021. These ratings are out of step with reality, a conclusion shared by NYS Comptroller DiNapoli in a September 2020 audit . I will push to have this system revamped and updated, which would challenge us to do better as a city. Additionally, the Mayor’s Office of Operations has a Street Conditions Observation Unit (SCOUT) that “works to improve quality of life in city neighborhoods and make city government more responsive to conditions that can negatively affect NYC residents,” yet this unit is unknown to most New Yorkers and does not directly coordinate with local elected officials and community boards. This unit has potential and I will push to make it a more central element of our sanitation efforts.

All four of these Community Boards were given a 100 percent sidewalk cleanliness rating for quarter 2 of Fiscal Year 2021. These ratings are out of step with reality, a conclusion shared by NYS Comptroller DiNapoli in a September 2020 audit . I will push to have this system revamped and updated, which would challenge us to do better as a city. Additionally, the Mayor’s Office of Operations has a Street Conditions Observation Unit (SCOUT) that “works to improve quality of life in city neighborhoods and make city government more responsive to conditions that can negatively affect NYC residents,” yet this unit is unknown to most New Yorkers and does not directly coordinate with local elected officials and community boards. This unit has potential and I will push to make it a more central element of our sanitation efforts. Expand Food Recovery Efforts We must do a better job of recovering leftover food from restaurants and other food establishments, in order to help address food insecurity and divert that food from the waste stream. Currently, 68% of all food waste that is discarded in New York"

I’m excited to make this vision a reality as a member of the New York City Council. Yours always, Erik Bottcher The ‘Clean District 3’ Sanitation Plan Increase Corner Basket Pickup As a member of the City Council, I will fight for a significant increase in corner basket service. Last year, in order to close the budget gap, the Department of Sanitation’s budget was slashed by $106 million. Weekly litter basket runs were cut by 63 percent—from 736 to 272. Sunday basket service was eliminated entirely. Some service was restored, but not in Council District 3. We need a full restoration of basket service, and an increase over time, because overflowing waste baskets were a chronic problem even before the COVID-19 crisis. Increase & Improve Street Cleaning Street cleaning needs to be restored to two days a week. It was reduced to once a week in June of 2020 by Mayor de Blasio, resulting in trash accumulation on side streets, alongside parked cars and in gutters. I will also push for the purchase of smaller street sweepers that are able to properly clean narrow bike lanes. Many bike lanes are too narrow for full-size street sweepers, and they frequently accumulate trash. The Hudson River Park Trust uses small street sweepers to clean the West Side Bikeway, and we need them for bike lanes throughout Council District 3. Create Borough-wide DSNY ‘Strike Teams’ that Respond to 311 Calls in Real Time I am proposing the creation of ‘strike teams’ of sanitation workers who are assigned to cover each borough, responding in real-time to 311 complaints of overflowing waste baskets and other unsanitary conditions. This would help prevent sanitation issues from going unresolved for long periods of time, which compromises quality of life, public health and rodent control. Use On-Street Containers, Not Sidewalks, for Garbage Collection On trash collection days, New Yorkers are currently forced to walk by mountains of trash bags that take up valuable sidewalk space. It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of piling bags on the sidewalk in front of each building for collection, the city should allow residential communities to use on-street containers or corrals in centralized locations on each block, like they do in parts of Buenos Aires and Barcelona . This concept is currently being piloted by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Sanitation in Business Improvement Districts primarily, but it should be expanded to more neighborhoods immediately and give New Yorkers relief from congested and unsanitary sidewalks.

New York City’s waste alone is responsible for 1.7 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year, primarily due to food waste. did so 1 million tons of garbage from landfills each year 1.7 million tons As District 3 Chief of Staff in Speaker Corey Johnson’s office, I helped substantially increase organic waste programs in Council District 3, including facilitating the adoption of curbside pickup at Westbeth, Penn South and Manhattan Plaza and new drop-off locations throughout the district. Better Regulate Corner Newspaper Boxes Corner newspaper boxes are often filthy, covered with graffiti and stickers, broken, and filled with litter. I will fight for stricter standards with respect to design, placement, and maintenance of newspaper/magazine dispensers. If elected, I will co-sponsor legislation similar to that introduced by Council Member Danny Dromm. legislation Ban More Single Use Plastics Plastic waste is killing our marine ecosystem and littering our neighborhoods. I will fight for the phasing out of single-use plastics in New York City, including plastic straws, stir sticks, and single-use water bottles. The NYC Department of Sanitation collected roughly 36 million pounds of single-use plastics from homes each year across the five boroughs in 2017. The department estimates that commercial establishments contribute tens of million more pounds to that number. To help reduce our reliance on single-use water bottles, we should pilot reusable water bottle refilling stations at fire hydrants, and they did in Montreal . While banning plastic bags and polystyrene foam were positive steps, we need to go much further if we are to save our ecosystem. in Montreal A More Accurate Sanitation Scorecard The Mayor’s Office of Operations issues Street & Sidewalk Cleanliness Ratings , but the process is opaque and the cleanliness scores don’t always correspond to conditions on the ground. For example, 94.1 percent of streets in Community Board 2, 88.9 percent of streets in Community Board 4, and 93.7 percent of streets in Community Board 5 were rated “acceptably clean” in the November 2020 monthly report . All four of these Community Boards were given a 100 percent sidewalk cleanliness rating for quarter 2 of Fiscal Year 2021. These ratings are out of step with reality, a conclusion shared by NYS Comptroller DiNapoli in a September 2020 audit . I will push to have this system revamped and updated, which would challenge us to do better as a city. Additionally, the Mayor’s Office of Operations has a Street Conditions Observation Unit (SCOUT) that “works to improve quality of life in city neighborhoods and make city government more responsive to conditions that can negatively affect NYC residents,” yet this unit is unknown to most New Yorkers and does not directly coordinate with"

Currently, 68% of all food waste that is discarded in New York City is still edible. I will push the next mayoral administration on this issue and introduce legislation if necessary. In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, when more New Yorkers are experiencing food insecurity, it is essential that we expand our food waste and recovery practices. 68% of all food waste that is discarded ### Erik will not accept contributions from real estate developers, anyone employed at a lobbying firm, corporate political action committees (PACs), or the fossil fuel industry.
