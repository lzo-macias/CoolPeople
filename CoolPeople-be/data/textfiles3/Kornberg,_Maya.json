Public service is my core value. I have worked on promoting a stronger democracy at non-profits, international development organizations, and universities. My book “ Inside Congressional Committees, \" which was published last year, explores our legislative system and how to make it more representative and functional. I hold a PhD in political science and have taught undergraduate and graduate political science courses. I teach students that they should think critically about our political system and be an active part of shaping it. I am currently a Senior Research Fellow and Manager at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. I work on combatting political violence, creating policy solutions that keep big money out of our politics, and making Congress and local governments work effectively. My work and commentary has appeared in the Washington Post, NPR, BBC, MSNBC, Scientific American, Newsweek, CSPAN, The Hill, Slate, The New York Times, Bloomberg, and other outlets. In Brooklyn, I’ve dedicated myself to local activism. I spend weekends campaigning for Democratic candidates at our farmers markets and subway stations and knocking on doors. I love being an active member of local political clubs, the food coop, and other groups that bring together the community in this wonderful district. I believe that community starts with family, those we are born into and those we create. In October 2024, I became a mom to our beautiful baby boy Liam. My spouse and I love being parents and connecting with other parents and families in the district. I am a sister, daughter, spouse, friend, and ally and I am proud to add the role of “mom.” check out our Flickr here Hi, I’m Maya! Hi, I’m Maya! Public service is my core value.

I believe that community starts with family, those we are born into and those we create. In October 2024, I became a mom to our beautiful baby boy Liam. My spouse and I love being parents and connecting with other parents and families in the district. I am a sister, daughter, spouse, friend, and ally and I am proud to add the role of “mom.” Paid for by Maya for Council"

Public service is my core value. I have worked on promoting a stronger democracy at non-profits, international development organizations, and universities. My book “ Inside Congressional Committees, \" which was published last year, explores our legislative system and how to make it more representative and functional. I hold a PhD in political science and have taught undergraduate and graduate political science courses. I teach students that they should think critically about our political system and be an active part of shaping it. I am currently a Senior Research Fellow and Manager at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. I work on combatting political violence, creating policy solutions that keep big money out of our politics, and making Congress and local governments work effectively.

Trump took office and immediately took aim at our basic rights and values. I’ve spent my career protecting our democracy. As your Council Member, I’ll continue standing up to Trump and fighting to protect our democracy from City Hall. We must invest in our schools and healthcare system, build robust civic engagement to restore trust in government, organize for action, and protect our immigrant neighbors. We don’t have a minute to waste. It’s time to take the fight to Trump and here’s how we’re going to do it: Increase investment in our schools and protect students from Trump’s immigration policies Trump has threatened to dissolve the Department of Education and stop critical conversations about issues like race from taking place in classrooms. But Washington only provides between a tenth and quarter of funding for K-12 education. I know as an educator that civic education is the bedrock of democracy. We must invest in our schools, protect students from Trump’s immigration policies, and make sure classrooms remain a place for critical thought and culturally responsive pedagogy. Build safe and accessible NYC transportation infrastructure and protect congestion pricing Trump has directed agencies to roll back critical policies designed to limit CO2 emissions, and he revoked Biden’s plan to ensure half of all new vehicles are electric. As with education, a majority of transportation infrastructure does not come from the federal budget. We need to create a safe, accessible subway system; invest in bike lanes; and promote sustainable building. We must protect congestion pricing and double down on policies that support a growing population and plan for a warming climate. Increase investment in women's health and accessible healthcare for all Trump says repealing the Affordable Care Act is one of his key priorities, and he has threatened to further limit access to abortion by doing things like reinstating the 19th Century Comstock Act (which bans the mailing of abortion pills). I’ve been teaching about the Comstock Act for years now in my American political development course. The original act directly targeted immigrant communities, women, and other marginalized groups, and this reinstatement would do the same. We have to make sure that everyone has access to healthcare, which is a basic human right. And we have to invest in women’s health, reproductive health, and maternal health as we face an attack on women that disproportionately targets women of color. Build civic engagement to restore trust in government Trump is undermining trust in our democratic institutions. When the President claims that our election was rigged and breaks down basic checks and balances, he is endangering the one thing all democracies rely on: trust. Research tells us that Americans don’t think our institutions matter and don’t think politicians are listening to them. I know from my work promoting responsive lawmaking in states, in Congress, and in legislatures around the world that rebuilding trust in government is the most important way to protect our democracy. Programs like participatory budgeting, platforms that allow citizens to take an active part in legislation, inclusive town halls designed to meet everyone, and civic education programs are more important than ever. Learn from history to harness disappointment into action Trump is trying to seize more power for the presidency. I’ve studied Congress my entire career, and the era most similar to this one is the Watergate era. Like Trump, Nixon spied on citizens, used agencies to retaliate against political enemies, and lied to Congress. In the election after the Watergate scandal, over 90 new members of Congress were elected, and many of them ran to create change. In the 1970s, Congress passed campaign finance reform, solidified their “power of the purse”, limited presidential power in foreign wars, and made dramatic changes to legislative procedure.

Trump took office and immediately took aim at our basic rights and values. I’ve spent my career protecting our democracy. As your Council Member, I’ll continue standing up to Trump and fighting to protect our democracy from City Hall. We must invest in our schools and healthcare system, build robust civic engagement to restore trust in government, organize for action, and protect our immigrant neighbors. We don’t have a minute to waste. It’s time to take the fight to Trump and here’s how we’re going to do it: Increase investment in our schools and protect students from Trump’s immigration policies Trump has threatened to dissolve the Department of Education and stop critical conversations about issues like race from taking place in classrooms. But Washington only provides between a tenth and quarter of funding for K-12 education. I know as an educator that civic education is the bedrock of democracy. We must invest in our schools, protect students from Trump’s immigration policies, and make sure classrooms remain a place for critical thought and culturally responsive pedagogy. Build safe and accessible NYC transportation infrastructure and protect congestion pricing Trump has directed agencies to roll back critical policies designed to limit CO2 emissions, and he revoked Biden’s plan to ensure half of all new vehicles are electric. As with education, a majority of transportation infrastructure does not come from the federal budget. We need to create a safe, accessible subway system; invest in bike lanes; and promote sustainable building. We must protect congestion pricing and double down on policies that support a growing population and plan for a warming climate. Increase investment in women's health and accessible healthcare for all Trump says repealing the Affordable Care Act is one of his key priorities, and he has threatened to further limit access to abortion by doing things like reinstating the 19th Century Comstock Act (which bans the mailing of abortion pills). I’ve been teaching about the Comstock Act for years now in my American political development course. The original act directly targeted immigrant communities, women, and other marginalized groups, and this reinstatement would do the same. We have to make sure that everyone has access to healthcare, which is a basic human right. And we have to invest in women’s health, reproductive health, and maternal health as we face an attack on women that disproportionately targets women of color. Build civic engagement to restore trust in government Trump is undermining trust in our democratic institutions. When the President claims that our election was rigged and breaks down basic checks and balances, he is endangering the one thing all democracies rely on: trust. Research tells us that Americans don’t think our institutions matter and don’t think politicians are listening to them. I know from my work promoting responsive lawmaking in states, in Congress, and in legislatures around the world that rebuilding trust in government is the most important way to protect our democracy. Programs like participatory budgeting, platforms that allow citizens to take an active part in legislation, inclusive town halls designed to meet everyone, and civic education programs are more important than ever. Learn from history to harness disappointment into action Trump is trying to seize more power for the presidency. I’ve studied Congress my entire career, and the era most similar to this one is the Watergate era.

In the election after the Watergate scandal, over 90 new members of Congress were elected, and many of them ran to create change.

When the President claims that our election was rigged and breaks down basic checks and balances, he is endangering the one thing all democracies rely on: trust.

In the election after the Watergate scandal, over 90 new members of Congress were elected, and many of them ran to create change. In the 1970s, Congress passed campaign finance reform, solidified their “power of the purse”, limited presidential power in foreign wars, and made dramatic changes to legislative procedure.

    "text": "all Trump says repealing the Affordable Care Act is one of his key priorities, and he has threatened to further limit access to abortion by doing things like reinstating the 19th Century Comstock Act (which bans the mailing of abortion pills). I’ve been teaching about the Comstock Act for years now in my American political development course. The original act directly targeted immigrant communities, women, and other marginalized groups, and this reinstatement would do the same. We have to make sure that everyone has access to healthcare, which is a basic human right. And we have to invest in women’s health, reproductive health, and maternal health as we face an attack on women that disproportionately targets women of color. Build civic engagement to restore trust in government Trump is undermining trust in our democratic institutions. When the President claims that our election was rigged and breaks down basic checks and balances, he is endangering the one thing all democracies rely on: trust. Research tells us that Americans don’t think our institutions matter and don’t think politicians are listening to them. I know from my work promoting responsive lawmaking in states, in Congress, and in legislatures around the world that rebuilding trust in government is the most important way to protect our democracy. Programs like participatory budgeting, platforms that allow citizens to take an active part in legislation, inclusive town halls designed to meet everyone, and civic education programs are more important than ever.

Learn from history to harness disappointment into action Trump is trying to seize more power for the presidency. I’ve studied Congress my entire career, and the era most similar to this one is the Watergate era. Like Trump, Nixon spied on citizens, used agencies to retaliate against political enemies, and lied to Congress. In the election after the Watergate scandal, over 90 new members of Congress were elected, and many of them ran to create change. In the 1970s, Congress passed campaign finance reform, solidified their “power of the purse”, limited presidential power in foreign wars, and made dramatic changes to legislative procedure. We must similarly use this moment of profound disappointment as a catalyst for making a more equitable and just city and country.

It is time to come together and focus on building consensus and driving progressive change in New York City. I am committed to creating a greener district with sustainable, safer, and more accessible transportation options and more affordable housing. As a parent, I am passionate about expanding access to affordable childcare and great schools in our district and throughout the city. My experience working to stop political violence equips me to champion policies that promote safety and sustainability for our community. I’ve spent my career trying to make democracy work better, and I believe we deserve more responsive leadership and a City Council Member who centers constituent services and delivers meaningful change. I am committed to creating a greener district with sustainable, safer, and more accessible transportation options and more affordable housing. As a parent,"

The most important job of a City Council Member is to engage with local constituents. I’ve spent my career working on creating more responsive governance, and I know the number one rule is that people want to be heard, and government works better when it listens. We need the basics - a continuously open district office and constituent requests that are answered in a timely manner, but that’s just the start. I know from my work that it is particularly important to proactively engage disengaged communities (many of whom face barriers to engagement.) I will host monthly town halls that meet people where they are (at senior centers, places of worship, gyms, parks, bars, libraries community centers) with virtual engagement options for those who cannot join in person (including people with mobility issues or care obligations) and opportunities to send feedback and ideas via phone or send a video recording with sign language. I also know from my work with legislators that many constituents may not know who to contact about an issue or where to find their council member: I will work with my staff to set up “constituent service” tables at parks and other public spaces so that people can resolve their issues. In a diverse district, we need culturally competent and varied engagement opportunities that are created together with those with different lived experiences. I speak four languages (English, Spanish, Hebrew, and Arabic) and have worked on getting information on government and voting out to non-English speaking communities. I will prioritize creating non-English language opportunities for engagement and hiring staff with different language skills and lived experiences. Another step is to invest in youth engagement, something I’m very passionate about as a college professor. Let’s continue with youth councils, but also invest in more internship programs for high school and college aged young people, more civic education in coordination with the NYC civic engagement commission. Community boards are an amazing tool for engagement, but we have to make sure they are truly representative and accessible. When there is an opaque appointment process controlled by the Borough President, meetings are at night, and board members are not compensated in any way, we shouldn’t be surprised our community boards are not representative of our community. I’ve worked with other countries that have engagement platforms and we know that providing childcare and transportation subsidies, flexible meeting and engagement times, and a transparent appointment process are crucial to creating real engagement. We must bring that to our community boards. As a Council Member, engaging with the community will be my number one priority. I want to hear from you . HERE Reinvigorate Civic Engagment .

This comes on the heels of Kornberg receiving the endorsement of Independent Neighborhood Democrats (IND) this past Friday. CBID and IND are the two major reform Democratic clubs covering the 39th District. Especially notable is that Kornberg is the only non-incumbent endorsed by either club for City Council. “I am so honored to be endorsed by both CBID and IND,” said Maya Kornberg, Democratic candidate for City Council in District 39. “As a member of both of these reform Democratic clubs, I have seen the amazing work that CBID and IND members do in our community to support Democratic candidates and advance progressive values. I am especially proud to be the only non-incumbent endorsed by either club for City Council this cycle. Receiving both endorsements is a resounding show of grassroots support and a humbling vote of confidence. I look forward to continuing to work with both CBID and IND.” Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats (CBID), founded in 1968, is a progressive and reform-minded Democratic club covering the 44th and 52nd Assembly Districts—covering most of District 39. Independent Neighborhood Democrats (IND) was founded in 1970 as a reform Democratic club covering the 52nd Assembly District. In 2024, IND and CBID both appeared in City & State's ranking of New York’s top political clubs. Since launching her campaign two months ago, Kornberg has also received the endorsements of former Assemblymembers Joan Millman (AD-44) and Jim Brennan (AD-52), as well as Democratic District Leader Doug Schneider (AD-44). Maya Kornberg is a new mom, advocate, author, educator, and Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. She is running for New York City Council District 39 to bring a results-driven progressive approach to City Hall. Maya will fight to protect our democracy, increase childcare access, tackle the housing affordability crisis, improve our schools, build green infrastructure, and create safer streets through accountable policing. Maya has dedicated her career to making democracy work better for the people it's meant to serve, including combating political violence and creating more responsive government processes. Her work has been featured in the Washington Post, Newsweek, the Hill, and NPR. Maya has taught graduate and undergraduate political courses at NYU, Georgetown, Oxford, and American University.

I’ve dedicated my career to making democracy work better, and as a City Council Member, I will focus on standing up against hate, providing reliable constituent services, and delivering meaningful change for every resident in every corner of the district.” The 39th District includes the neighborhoods of Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Kensington, Borough Park, Gowanus, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill, and the Columbia Waterfront. The Democratic Primary will be held on June 24, 2025. Maya Kornberg is a new mom, advocate, author, educator, and Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. She is running for New York City Council District 39 to bring a results-driven progressive approach to City Hall. Maya will fight to protect our democracy, increase childcare access, tackle the housing affordability crisis, improve our schools, build green infrastructure, and create safer streets through accountable policing. Maya has dedicated her career to making democracy work better for the people it's meant to serve, including combating political violence and creating more responsive government processes. Her work has been featured in the Washington Post, Newsweek, the Hill, and NPR. Maya has taught graduate and undergraduate political courses at NYU, Georgetown, Oxford, and American University.

The district needs a representative in City Hall who will put service over ideology and prioritize the needs of her constituents. Maya will be that representative. It’s my pleasure to endorse her campaign to represent District 39 on the City Council.\" Joan Millman served in the New York State Assembly from 1997 to 2014. Millman represented the 52nd Assembly District in the seat now held by Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon, which includes the neighborhoods of Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Gowanus, and Park Slope — all of which overlap with the 39th Council District. In the Assembly, she chaired the Committee on Aging, the Commission on Government Administration, and the Task Force on Women’s Issues. “Maya is a progressive who will bring a much-needed pragmatic and results-driven approach to City Hall,” said former Assemblymember Jim Brennan (AD-44). “As a Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, Maya is a leader in making legislative bodies more efficient and effective, combatting the rise of political violence, and fighting the spread of misinformation. As District 39’s Council Member, she will be a true partner to the many diverse groups in our community and work tirelessly to provide fast and effective constituent services. I am proud to endorse her candidacy to represent District 39 in the New York City Council.” Jim Brennan served in the New York State Assembly from 1985 to 2016. Brennan represented the 44th Assembly District in the seat now held by Robert Carroll, which includes the neighborhoods of Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Kensington, and Borough Park — all of which overlap with the 39th Council District. During his three decades of service, he chaired four committees and won three national awards for his legislative work. Since launching her campaign just over a month ago, Kornberg has reached the maximum threshold of public matching funds and continued to gain support from across the 39th District. The endorsements of Assemblymembers Millman and Brennan, who have collectively served the neighborhoods of District 39 for nearly 50 years, are a clear statement that Maya will bring effective, responsive, and responsible representation to City Hall. Maya Kornberg is a new mom, advocate, author, educator, and Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. She is running for New York City Council District 39 to bring a results-driven progressive approach to City Hall. Maya will fight to protect our democracy, increase childcare access, tackle the housing affordability crisis, improve our schools, build green infrastructure, and create safer streets through accountable policing. Maya has dedicated her career to making democracy work better for the people it's meant to serve, including combating political violence and creating more responsive government processes. Her work has been featured in the Washington Post, Newsweek, the Hill, and NPR. Maya has taught graduate and undergraduate political courses at NYU, Georgetown, Oxford, and American University. Maya and her spouse rent an apartment in Park Slope where they are raising their newborn son. ### Maya Kornberg Former Brooklyn Assemblymembers Endorse Maya Kornberg for City Council District 39 PRESS RELEASE Jan 22 Written By Maya Kornberg Former Assemblymembers Joan Millman and Jim Brennan endorse ‘pragmatic and results-driven’ Democratic"

I am proud to endorse her candidacy to represent District 39 in the New York City Council.” Jim Brennan served in the New York State Assembly from 1985 to 2016.

During his three decades of service, he chaired four committees and won three national awards for his legislative work. Since launching her campaign just over a month ago, Kornberg has reached the maximum threshold of public matching funds and continued to gain support from across the 39th District. The endorsements of Assemblymembers Millman and Brennan, who have collectively served the neighborhoods of District 39 for nearly 50 years, are a clear statement that Maya will bring effective, responsive, and responsible representation to City Hall. Maya Kornberg is a new mom, advocate, author, educator, and Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. She is running for New York City Council District 39 to bring a results-driven progressive approach to City Hall. Maya will fight to protect our democracy, increase childcare access, tackle the housing affordability crisis, improve our schools, build green infrastructure, and create safer streets through accountable policing. Maya has dedicated her career to making democracy work better for the people it's meant to serve, including combating political violence and creating more responsive government processes. Her work has been featured in the Washington Post, Newsweek, the Hill, and NPR. Maya has taught graduate and undergraduate political courses at NYU, Georgetown, Oxford, and American University. Maya and her spouse rent an apartment in Park Slope where they are raising their newborn son. ### Maya Kornberg Former Brooklyn Assemblymembers Endorse Maya Kornberg for City Council District 39 PRESS RELEASE Jan 22 Written By Maya Kornberg Former Assemblymembers Joan Millman and Jim Brennan endorse ‘pragmatic and results-driven’ Democratic"

Brennan represented the 44th Assembly District in the seat now held by Robert Carroll, which includes the neighborhoods of Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Kensington, and Borough Park — all of which overlap with the 39th Council District. During his three decades of service, he chaired four committees and won three national awards for his legislative work. Since launching her campaign just over a month ago, Kornberg has reached the maximum threshold of public matching funds and continued to gain support from across the 39th District. The endorsements of Assemblymembers Millman and Brennan, who have collectively served the neighborhoods of District 39 for nearly 50 years, are a clear statement that Maya will bring effective, responsive, and responsible representation to City Hall. Maya Kornberg is a new mom, advocate, author, educator, and Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. She is running for New York City Council District 39 to bring a results-driven progressive approach to City Hall. Maya will fight to protect our democracy, increase childcare access, tackle the housing affordability crisis, improve our schools, build green infrastructure, and create safer streets through accountable policing. Maya has dedicated her career to making democracy work better for the people it's meant to serve, including combating political violence and creating more responsive government processes. Her work has been featured in the Washington Post, Newsweek, the Hill, and NPR. Maya has taught graduate and undergraduate political courses at NYU, Georgetown, Oxford, and American University. Maya and her spouse rent an apartment in Park Slope where they are raising their newborn son. ### ### Maya Kornberg Previous Previous Jewish voters in Park Slope say they are ready for a change Jewish voters in Park Slope say they are ready for a change Maya Kornberg pitches ‘pragmatic progressivism’ in Brooklyn council race Paid for by Maya for Council"

In the Assembly, she chaired the Committee on Aging, the Commission on Government Administration, and the Task Force on Women’s Issues. “Maya is a progressive who will bring a much-needed pragmatic and results-driven approach to City Hall,” said former Assemblymember Jim Brennan (AD-44). “As a Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, Maya is a leader in making legislative bodies more efficient and effective, combatting the rise of political violence, and fighting the spread of misinformation.

This irresponsible and antisemitic misinformation is unfortunately being proliferated here in District 39. Lies that my campaign is being funded by AIPAC, an organization focused on foreign policy, call up both of these antisemitic tropes and amounts to nothing more than a smear campaign. I am a proud Jewish woman and fighting antisemitism and racist hate will continue to be my priority. I have not received nor will I receive support from AIPAC, a group that doesn’t even get involved in city council races. And like many progressive Jews here in District 39, I disagree with some of AIPAC’s stances. This campaign is, and has always been, focused on the local issues that affect our communities and unite us as Democrats: affordability, healthcare, education, and equality. I’ve spent years working to combat misinformation in politics and I think we’ve certainly all seen enough of it over the past year. And despite these lies being spewed about my campaign and about me, I will continue to run a positive campaign focused on the local issues that affect District 39 residents every day.” Maya Kornberg is a new mom, advocate, author, educator, and Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. She is running for New York City Council District 39 to bring a results-driven progressive approach to City Hall. Maya will fight to protect our democracy, increase childcare access, tackle the housing affordability crisis, improve our schools, build green infrastructure, and create safer streets through accountable policing. Maya has dedicated her career to making democracy work better for the people it's meant to serve, including combating political violence and creating more responsive government processes. Her work has been featured in the Washington Post, Newsweek, the Hill, and NPR. Maya has taught graduate and undergraduate political courses at NYU, Georgetown, Oxford, and American University.

This irresponsible and antisemitic misinformation is unfortunately being proliferated here in District 39. Lies that my campaign is being funded by AIPAC, an organization focused on foreign policy, call up both of these antisemitic tropes and amounts to nothing more than a smear campaign. I am a proud Jewish woman and fighting antisemitism and racist hate will continue to be my priority. I have not received nor will I receive support from AIPAC, a group that doesn’t even get involved in city council races. And like many progressive Jews here in District 39, I disagree with some of AIPAC’s stances. This campaign is, and has always been, focused on the local issues that affect our communities and unite us as Democrats: affordability, healthcare, education, and equality. I’ve spent years working to combat misinformation in politics and I think we’ve certainly all seen enough of it over the past year. And despite these lies being spewed about my campaign and about me, I will continue to run a positive campaign focused on the local issues"

This irresponsible and antisemitic misinformation is unfortunately being proliferated here in District 39. Lies that my campaign is being funded by AIPAC, an organization focused on foreign policy, call up both of these antisemitic tropes and amounts to nothing more than a smear campaign. I am a proud Jewish woman and fighting antisemitism and racist hate will continue to be my priority. I have not received nor will I receive support from AIPAC, a group that doesn’t even get involved in city council races. And like many progressive Jews here in District 39, I disagree with some of AIPAC’s stances. This campaign is, and has always been, focused on the local issues that affect our communities and unite us as Democrats: affordability, healthcare, education, and equality. I’ve spent years working to combat misinformation in politics and I think we’ve certainly all seen enough of it over the past year. And despite these lies being spewed about my campaign and about me, I will continue to run a positive campaign focused on the local issues that affect District 39 residents every day.” Maya Kornberg is a new mom, advocate, author, educator, and Senior Research Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. She is running for New York City Council District 39 to bring a results-driven progressive approach to City Hall.

You can order your copy here: Amazon Barnes&Noble Columbia University Press Indiepubs It is widely believed that Congress has broken down. Media accounts present the storied legislature as thoroughly gridlocked, paralyzed by partisan rancor. Political scientists find that Congress is passing fewer laws and spending less time on legislative work. Which parts of a supposedly dysfunctional legislature continue to function? This book examines the legislative process beyond voting patterns, emphasizing the crucial role of congressional committee hearings. In committees, lawmakers hear from expert witnesses, legislators revise and discuss bills before bringing them to a vote, and the public has an opportunity to engage with Congress. The book scrutinizes the inner workings of committees—the different types of witnesses who testify, the varied hearings Congress holds, and the distinct effects that committee work has on Congresspeople. It deploys original mixed-methods datasets that span from insider interviews to sentiment analysis examining the language used in hearings. The book evaluates how committees operate and the conditions affecting their performance, finding that committee work can be more deliberative and productive than the politics of the Congress floor. Through a comprehensive exploration of who committees hear from and how they listen, this book demonstrates that Congress is not as dysfunctional as is often claimed. Inside Congressional Committees also suggests timely reforms based on these findings that can strengthen Congress. Reviews “Maya L. Kornberg has produced a rich, informative, and beautifully written study of the internal operations of the contemporary Congress. Inside Congressional Committees is a refreshingly balanced perspective, one that offers a nuanced understanding of Congress’s strengths, weaknesses, and complex institutional realities.” Frances E. Lee, Princeton University “This creative and impressive book shines a welcome light on the political underbelly of committees in the U.S. Congress. Marshalling a remarkable array of evidence, Kornberg pinpoints the roles of norms and relationships in sustaining committees as arenas of bipartisan problem solving. She advances a nuanced, clear-eyed view of the potential and pitfalls of today’s committees.” Sarah Binder, George Washington University “Kornberg significantly increases our understanding of how congressional committee hearings are structured, who testifies at them, what those witnesses say, and what impact the hearings have. This book is a must-read for scholars of Congress.” Josh Chafetz, Georgetown University “Everyone loves to hate Congress for being dysfunctional, polarized, and weak. Kornberg’s elegant study asks us to think twice. She carefully examines how congressional committees actually channel expertise and discourse, why that matters, and where to focus any efforts to make it better.” William J.
