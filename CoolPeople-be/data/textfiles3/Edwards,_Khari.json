We can improve the affordability of housing by creating more local jobs that pay living wages. We can address food insecurity and mental health services by investing in our physical health and that will lead to a more productive human economy. The bottom line is that our communities have an inequitable distribution of resources, funding, and compassion. We need to ensure that Brownsville feels the same level of investment and attention as Park Slope. That East New York feels as supported as Williamsburg.

From Brooklyn Heights to Coney Island. From Bay Ridge to Bushwick. We need to address the overall health of our communities. Not just the physical. But our mental, social, and economic health too. So many of the issues we face are interconnected. We can improve public safety by investing in education and job training. We can improve the affordability of housing by creating more local jobs that pay living wages. We can address food insecurity and mental health services by investing in our physical health and that will lead to a more productive human economy. The bottom line is that our communities have an inequitable distribution of resources, funding, and compassion. We need to ensure that Brownsville feels the same level of investment and attention as Park Slope. That East New York feels as supported as Williamsburg. That Flatbush feels like their issues are being heard just as much as Cobble Hill. Inequality continues to grow at a rapid pace. We need a BP that can look holistically at the issues affecting every corner of the borough and allocate and advocate for resources that will rebuild our communities.

Cuomo’s proposal to raid dedicated funding to the MTA by $160 million, Brooklyn Borough President candidate Khari Edwards released the following statement: “These vital funds were set aside to help New York’s struggling subway and bus system and to see a raid proposed like this during a pandemic is very disappointing,” said Brooklyn Borough President Candidate Khari Edwards. “I have confidence that state legislators will not let funds for public transportation be stolen. As a lifelong Brooklynite, I know how vital the MTA is for our communities and believe that as the city reopens, we must focus on increasing accessibility to transportation deserts like southeast Brooklyn, not taking away service.” April 1 is the deadline for the State budget to pass.

Khari made history as the hospital’s first Vice President of color. During his tenure, Khari crafted and executed a strategic plan to build community trust with the 1.3 million Brooklynites who live in neighborhoods serviced by the hospital. Khari is also credited with spearheading a new initiative to increase census engagement in Central and North Brooklyn; creating the “It Starts Here” program, which connected over 2200 students with victims of gun violence; and organizing 250 union members, healthcare professionals, elected officials, and community stakeholders to address health, housing and employment disparities in East Brooklyn. Khari has worked for several elected officials, non-profit organizations, and city agencies where he focused on strengthening communities and connecting Brooklynites to vital social services. During his time with the State Legislature, Khari worked with every hospital in Brooklyn to address healthcare inequities and potential hospital closures. As the Brooklyn Council President for Make-A-Wish New York, Khari led a two-year campaign to enlist volunteers to enroll over 400 wish granters for children in Brooklyn.

City-data released shows that only 1.9% to 2.5% of residents in the ZIP codes that make up Brownsville, East New York, and Cypress Hills were fully vaccinated. Demographics from NYU’s Furman Cente r show that the majority of residents living in these communities are black and brown New Yorkers. Meanwhile in a ZIP code covering Brooklyn Heights, DUMBO, and Cobble Hill, 6.3% of residents had been fully vaccinated. These figures will be not lost on any elected official when they run for reelection, including the Governor. As healthcare leaders with over 40 years of combined experience, we understand the hesitancy communities of color have towards vaccines. Communities of color have endured a long history of indifference, and worse, outright abuse in medical research in the United States. It is no surprise that according to a 2020 poll from Undefeated and the Kaiser Family Foundation , 7 in 10 Black Americans believe that people are treated unfairly based on race or ethnicity when they seek medical care. We also know that from March through May, city data showed that Black and Latino New Yorkers were twice as likely to die from COVID than their white counterparts . Beyond these trusted sources, we have seen first hand from working on the frontlines at Brookdale Hospital in Brownsville, Brooklyn, one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York City, how communities of color have to endure old equipment, lack of PPE, and higher mortality rates without any meaningful help from the Governor or Mayor. We saw Brookdale’s morgue overfilled, the ICU at capacity, and the pediatric emergency department converted into a Covid-19 isolation area. We strongly believe and encourage everyone to get the vaccine, and it is the responsibility of the Governor and Mayor to make that happen quickly and equally. The Governor and Mayor need to meet their responsibility by communicating directly with communities of color to make sure they have a space to ask questions, get answers, and learn about efficacy. This will empower New Yorkers with the information they desperately need to make decisions. The Governor and Mayor need to create real access points with enough time for the community to learn about them. Otherwise, we will continue to see shameful waste where providers are forced to throw away vaccines because they cannot find enough eligible people to vaccinate. As vaccine eligibility continues to expand, the Governor and Mayor must act faster to get the vaccine out to communities of color who have clearly, once again, been left to bear the brunt of this deadly pandemic. Every neighborhood in New York City should have vaccination sites, which can be done by having the city and state government open more senior centers, underutilized office spaces, pharmacies, churches, and doctor’s offices to distribute vaccines. Once the sites are established, the people running the site need to have the mandate to vaccinate fairly, but most of all, not waste vaccines due to missed appointments. If someone is in line at the end of the day who may not have had an appointment or not be in a prioritized group, it is better to vaccinate someone than to waste. To reach older adults, outreach workers must be tasked with connecting with these New Yorkers, going door to door citywide. This is about creating equity in our city and another way we do that is by communicating directly with each of the languages spoken across the five boroughs, not just the people who speak English. Vaccination information and forms must be readily available in a multitude of languages and translators must be on-site to ensure everyone has equal access to the vaccine. Communities of color are often mistreated but the Governor and Mayor have an opportunity to change that, but so far, they are failing.

Promoting Brooklyn as the Destination Congestion pricing imposes tolls on vehicles entering Manhattan below 60th Street, but here’s the good news: Brooklyn businesses have a golden opportunity to attract customers who want to avoid fees while enjoying world-class dining, shopping, and cultural experiences. As your next Brooklyn Borough President, I will work tirelessly to ensure that businesses in every Brooklyn neighborhood—from Brownsville to Bay Ridge, Flatbush to Williamsburg—thrive under this new reality. My plan includes: Promoting Local Restaurants: Brooklyn’s diverse food scenes are second to none. From Caribbean cuisine in Crown Heights to Italian fare in Bensonhurst and vegan dining in Bushwick to our fabled Chinatown , there’s no reason to leave the borough for a great meal. Highlighting Retail Hubs: Brooklyn has vibrant shopping districts, from the boutiques of DUMBO to the iconic Fulton Mall to our many economic corridors . These businesses deserve support and recognition as alternative & primary destinations to Manhattan’s crowded shopping districts Showcasing Cultural Institutions and Destinations: Brooklyn is home to world-renowned museums, theaters, and cultural hubs, like the Brooklyn Museum, BAM, and Prospect Park. To expand our cultural footprint, we must also highlight treasures like the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, Weeksville Heritage Center, and the Jewish Museum. We will highlight our amazing local organizations who keep the culture rooted & future driven. These institutions deserve to be on everyone’s must-visit list.

From Caribbean cuisine in Crown Heights to Italian fare in Bensonhurst and vegan dining in Bushwick to our fabled Chinatown , there’s no reason to leave the borough for a great meal. Highlighting Retail Hubs: Brooklyn has vibrant shopping districts, from the boutiques of DUMBO to the iconic Fulton Mall to our many economic corridors . These businesses deserve support and recognition as alternative & primary destinations to Manhattan’s crowded shopping districts Showcasing Cultural Institutions and Destinations: Brooklyn is home to world-renowned museums, theaters, and cultural hubs, like the Brooklyn Museum, BAM, and Prospect Park. To expand our cultural footprint, we must also highlight treasures like the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, Weeksville Heritage Center, and the Jewish Museum. We will highlight our amazing local organizations who keep the culture rooted & future driven. These institutions deserve to be on everyone’s must-visit list. Plus the WNBA Champs, NY Liberty, are in Brooklyn. info Login to download LOGIN New user?

Rents are still too damn high and continue to soar, grocery prices feel like mortgage payments, and wages have not kept pace. Now, to make matters worse, Con Edison and National Grid are proposing rate hikes that will further squeeze working families, low-income households, and an already shrinking middle class. Energy is a necessity, not a luxury. Heat, electricity, and gas are essential to modern life, and yet, the corporations that control these utilities operate as if they are selling a premium service rather than a basic human need. These proposed increases, which could add hundreds of dollars to monthly bills, are nothing short of an economic stranglehold on Brooklynites and New Yorkers already struggling to stay afloat. The justification? A mix of corporate double-talk and backwards logic. The utilities argue that these hikes are necessary to maintain and upgrade infrastructure and to invest in renewable energy projects. info Login to download LOGIN New user?

Con Edison reported $1.68 billion in net income in 2023 , and National Grid’s U.S. operations remain highly profitable. So why should New Yorkers foot the bill when executives continue to collect massive salaries and shareholder dividends? Transitioning to renewable energy, particularly solar power, is essential for a sustainable future. Solar energy offers numerous benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, and providing long-term cost savings for consumers. Even if you are not a climate justice advocate, these hikes will affect everyone negatively. However, Con Edison cites investments in renewable energy infrastructure as one of the reasons for the proposed rate hikes, although less than a million homes are using renewable energy While developing green energy projects is crucial, the financial burden should not fall disproportionately on consumers, especially when these companies continue to post substantial profits. It's imperative that the transition to renewable energy is managed in a way that is equitable and does not exacerbate existing economic disparities. This is not just a pocketbook issue; it is a moral issue. A city where people cannot afford basic utilities is a city on the brink of collapse. If energy costs become more burdensome, families will have to make impossible choices—cutting back on food, medicine, or even rent to keep the lights and heat on. Governor Hochul has rightly taken a stance against these rate hikes, recognizing the catastrophic impact they would have. But she alone cannot stop them. The Public Service Commission, which oversees utility rates, must reject these proposed increases outright. Furthermore, we need systemic changes to how utilities operate in New York. Public ownership of utilities, stricter regulation, and price caps must all be on the table. New Yorkers should not be forced to bear the financial burden of corporate greed. These utility hikes are another example of big business tightening its grip on working people’s necks and wallets, all while the federal government rolls back protections meant to keep society fair and just. It is time to put political views aside and focus on what’s right and fight against our regulatory agencies, and the corporations"

As Borough President, Khari Edwards is committed to reinstating the position of Director or Liaison to community boards. This dedicated role will ensure that the community boards’ by-laws, voting issues, and membership applications are effectively managed by the Borough President's office, creating a direct line of communication between the community boards and the Borough President’s office. Supporting community leadership with regular meetings To foster stronger relationships between community boards and the Borough President’s office, Edwards will initiate bi-monthly meetings with the Chairs and District Managers of each community board. These meetings will serve as a vital forum to address the needs, issues, and concerns of each community, ensuring that the Borough President’s office is actively supporting community priorities. Additionally, quarterly meetings will include agency liaisons from city departments, ensuring that community concerns are connected with city resources and solutions. Funding community engagement initiatives Khari Edwards understands that vibrant community engagement is essential for healthy neighborhoods. To support community boards and their initiatives, Edwards will use the Borough President’s discretionary budget to fund events such as Community Board days, block parties, and concerts. These events will serve as opportunities for residents to come together, voice their concerns, and build a stronger sense of community. Personal commitment to community engagement As Borough President, Edwards will make it a priority to attend community board meetings every other month, schedule permitting, to stay closely connected with residents and local leaders. This personal involvement will ensure that the voices of Brooklyn’s diverse communities are heard and acted upon. Supporting caregivers and parents in the community Recognizing that many community members, especially mothers and caretakers, face challenges in attending meetings due to childcare responsibilities, Edwards will support these individuals by offering stipends for childcare on meeting nights. This initiative will help ensure that everyone, regardless of caregiving responsibilities, can fully participate in shaping their communities. A more connected, empowered Brooklyn By reinvigorating the relationship between community boards and the Borough President’s office, Edwards aims to empower community leaders, support local initiatives, and foster a sense of unity across Brooklyn. Through regular communication, funding for community events, and personal involvement, Edwards will ensure that the voices of all Brooklynites are heard and valued in the decision-making process.

Diana Nelson for over 10 years, dating back to my time at Brookdale. They are visionaries and leaders in East Flatbush, Brownsville, and Brooklyn. Their work—building affordable housing, employing minority contractors, and most importantly, giving hope—is a testament to their dedication to the community. Gratitude for a Meaningful Evening A heartfelt thank you to Bishop Nelson, Rev. Nelson, and the entire Ebenezer team for organizing such a meaningful evening of generosity and celebration. Brooklyn thrives because of leaders and organizations like Ebenezer Urban Ministry Center, who ensure no one is left behind. Spreading Love and Making a Difference Let’s continue to spread love and make a difference this holiday season. Together, we can build a stronger, more compassionate community. #BrooklynVested #CommunityMatters #holidaygiving Brookylm people Community Boards Storylines More Story Ideas OpEd: Con Edison's Rate Hike A Direct Attack on Brooklynites OpEd: Brooklyn Can Turn Congestion Pricing Into a Win Honoring Strength at The Gift of Life Women’s Event Khari Edwards: Advocating Education for Brooklyn Kids Khari Edwards champions affordable housing for Brooklyn Khari Edwards Hosts Gala Raising $1 Mil for NYC Youth Khari Edwards Gives Back: A Community Thanksgiving Strengthening Brooklyn's community boards for greater impact Compassionate mental health solutions for Brooklyn Privacy Statement Terms Of Use Disclaimer Contact Us Admin Login © Copyright 2024 Lookatmedia™.

His plan includes enhancements like broadband access, air conditioning, gymnasiums, and auditoriums to create better learning environments for all students. Turning schools into community centers Edwards proposes using a portion of the BP's budget to partner with the Department of Education (DOE) to keep schools open after hours. By allowing local nonprofits to use school spaces for free programming, he aims to transform schools into vibrant community centers that support local residents. Supporting teachers and students To address supply shortages, Edwards suggests using Borough Hall or local community offices as support depots for teachers. These centers would provide essential supplies to ensure that students have the resources they need to succeed. Funding college access programs Edwards plans to allocate funding to nonprofits that help children who aspire to attend college. By supporting these programs, Edwards aims to make higher education more accessible to Brooklyn's youth. Giving kids a breath of fresh air In collaboration with local philanthropies, Edwards wants to bring back the Fresh Air Fund. This initiative would provide financially struggling children with opportunities to experience nature through camps and outdoor activities, offering them a break from city life and enriching their childhood. Bridging the gap for english learners With a significant increase in English language learners (ELL) in Brooklyn’s schools, Edwards recognizes the need to address the growing gap in bilingual staff and English as a New Language (ENL) teachers. He will work to bridge this budget and talent gap, ensuring all students receive the support they need to succeed academically. Brooklyn Democrats Education Storylines Login to download New user?

He recognizes that when communities are deprived of resources like jobs, healthcare, and education, hope diminishes, leading to increased insecurity. Edwards advocates for addressing public safety by focusing on building stronger, more prosperous communities. Implicit bias training for police recruits One of Edwards’s first legislative goals is to implement mandatory implicit bias training for new police recruits, with refresher courses every five years. He proposes that existing officers attend a paid retreat for this same training to foster understanding and empathy. Edwards emphasizes that officers must learn to police with compassion, especially in unfamiliar communities. Situational awareness training for seniors and faith groups To enhance public safety, Edwards proposes funding for situational awareness and emergency management training, particularly for seniors and houses of worship. This training, hosted by Borough Hall, would equip vulnerable populations with the skills to recognize and respond to safety threats in their communities. Safe zone ambassadors to protect vulnerable areas Edwards also advocates for creating “safe zone ambassador” businesses and areas, which would be equipped with additional surveillance cameras to protect potential victims of crime. These zones would serve as refuges for those in need of protection, creating safer spaces throughout Brooklyn. Brookylm people Gun Violence Public Safety Seniors Login to download New user?

Providing activities for youth is crucial for keeping kids out of harms way as much as possible. #khariedwards #BrooklynYouth Khari Edwards believes that true public safety is rooted in creating opportunities for success. He recognizes that when communities are deprived of resources like jobs, healthcare, and education, hope diminishes, leading to increased insecurity. Edwards advocates for addressing public safety by focusing on building stronger, more prosperous communities. Implicit bias training for police recruits One of Edwards’s first legislative goals is to implement mandatory implicit bias training for new police recruits, with refresher courses every five years. He proposes that existing officers attend a paid retreat for this same training to foster understanding and empathy. Edwards emphasizes that officers must learn to police with compassion, especially in unfamiliar communities. Situational awareness training for seniors and faith groups To enhance public safety, Edwards proposes funding for situational awareness and emergency management training, particularly for seniors and houses of worship. This training, hosted by Borough Hall, would equip vulnerable populations with the skills to recognize and respond to safety threats in their communities. Safe zone ambassadors to protect vulnerable areas Edwards also advocates for creating “safe zone ambassador” businesses and areas, which would be equipped with additional surveillance cameras to protect potential victims of crime. These zones would serve as refuges for those in need of protection, creating safer spaces throughout Brooklyn. Brookylm people Gun Violence Public Safety Seniors Login to download New user?

This includes $450 million in capital funding and $100 million in operating support in the FY 2026 Executive Budget, building on $300 million in capital funding and $100 million in operating support from the FY 2025 Enacted Budget. The funding aims to modernize the facility, address health disparities, and secure its role as a healthcare provider and educator for Central Brooklyn. Khari Edwards Statement on SUNY Downstate Funding \"I’m thrilled that Governor Hochul has committed to keeping SUNY Downstate’s doors open with a significant infusion of capital funding. Fifteen years ago, I joined efforts to fight against the second Berger Commission’s push to close safety-net hospitals, and the fight for these critical institutions must continue. While this capital investment is a step in the right direction, it’s not enough. My hope is that the Governor will address Medicaid reimbursement rates, giving hospitals like Downstate a real chance to survive amidst federal challenges and looming Medicaid cuts that disproportionately impact low-income communities.\" Community Advisory Board Leads Strategic Planning A Community Advisory Board, established under the FY 2025 budget, is tasked with developing recommendations for the hospital's financial stability. The board will consider up to $750 million in state capital funding for investment, focusing on infrastructure needs, healthcare delivery trends, financial sustainability, and community health outcomes. Public input is being gathered through three hearings, with recommendations due by April 1, 2025. Addressing Critical Financial and Infrastructure Challenges SUNY Downstate has faced significant challenges, including a $100 million annual deficit and aging infrastructure. Governor Hochul's intervention prevented potential closure last year by allocating $400 million in funding and creating the advisory board. State officials and community leaders have emphasized the importance of this initiative in maintaining access to quality healthcare and training diverse medical professionals for future generations.

The innovative platform is designed to provide editorial-ready stories, press releases, and high-quality images, streamlining access to campaign updates and critical information. This initiative reflects Edwards’ commitment to leveraging technology to improve the lives of Brooklyn residents, ensuring vital resources and updates are readily available across the borough. “It’s time to bring 21st-century technology to Brooklyn,” Edwards said. “Brooklyn needs to reclaim its position as a leader in innovation. By embracing technology, we can improve areas such as education, healthcare, homeownership, and small businesses. This newsroom is a step toward making resources accessible to every resident.” The newsroom offers journalists and the public access to Edwards’ positions on key issues, including education, healthcare, public safety, housing, and economic development. Edwards intends to set a new standard for transparency and accessibility in political campaigns and governance. “Over the past few years, Brooklyn has taken many steps backward,” Edwards continued. “Housing has become unaffordable due to unchecked development, and we’re failing to promote equity throughout the borough. Technology can help bridge these gaps by connecting Brooklynites to affordable housing opportunities and essential resources. This is the type of forward-thinking leadership I plan to bring to Borough Hall.” In addition to transforming campaign communication,"

Rents are still too damn high and continue to soar, grocery prices feel like mortgage payments, and wages have not kept pace. Now, to make matters worse, Con Edison and National Grid are proposing rate hikes that will further squeeze working families, low-income households, and an already shrinking middle class. Energy is a necessity, not a luxury. Heat, electricity, and gas are essential to modern life, and yet, the corporations that control these utilities operate as if they are selling a premium service rather than a basic human need. These proposed increases, which could add hundreds of dollars to monthly bills, are nothing short of an economic stranglehold on Brooklynites and New Yorkers already struggling to stay afloat. The justification? A mix of corporate double-talk and backwards logic. The utilities argue that these hikes are necessary to maintain and upgrade infrastructure and to invest in renewable energy projects. But let’s be clear—these companies are not hurting for cash. Con Edison reported $1.68 billion in net income in 2023, and National Grid’s U.S. operations remain highly profitable. So why should New Yorkers foot the bill when executives continue to collect massive salaries and shareholder dividends? Transitioning to renewable energy, particularly solar power, is essential for a sustainable future. Solar energy offers numerous benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, and providing long-term cost savings for consumers. Even if you are not a climate justice advocate, these hikes will affect everyone negatively. However, Con Edison cites investments in renewable energy infrastructure as one of the reasons for the proposed rate hikes, although less than a million homes are using renewable energy While developing green energy projects is crucial, the financial burden should not fall disproportionately on consumers, especially when these companies continue to post substantial profits. It’s imperative that the transition to renewable energy is managed in a way that is equitable and does not exacerbate existing economic disparities. This is not just a pocketbook issue; it is a moral issue. A city where people cannot afford basic utilities is a city on the brink of collapse. If energy costs become more burdensome, families will have to make impossible choices—cutting back on food, medicine, or even rent to keep the lights and heat on. Governor Hochul has rightly taken a stance against these rate hikes, recognizing the catastrophic impact they would have. But she alone cannot stop them. The Public Service Commission, which oversees utility rates, must reject these proposed increases outright. Furthermore, we need systemic changes to how utilities operate in New York. Public ownership of utilities, stricter regulation, and price caps must all be on the table. New Yorkers should not be forced to bear the financial burden of corporate greed. These utility hikes are another example of big business tightening its grip on working people’s necks and wallets, all while the federal government rolls back protections meant to keep society fair and just. It is time to put political views aside and focus on what’s right and fight against our regulatory agencies, and the corporations that hold our most essential services hostage. The cost-of-living crisis in Brooklyn will only deepen if we do not push back against these predatory price hikes. We must act now—before we reach a point where the simple act of keeping the lights on becomes a luxury, rather than a basic right.
