A a work related injury ended my nursing career. I changed my major and earned a Bachelor of Arts in Business and Management with Adult Education and Psychology supports. I decided to work in healthcare administration and found training and developing staff to satisfy my desire to teach and be part of the nursing care team. Just before graduation, Zoreh Emami, my International Economics instructor at Alverno, asked a question that changed my life. She asked our class what we, as educated women, would do to other women . This sent me on an unexpected path to be a difference in the world and laid the foundation for my work with women and girls. Alverno College, Extraordinary Women in the Community, 2021 Helping Other Women Directly after college, I became a Probation and Parole Agent for the State of Wisconsin Department of Corrections. I was a Female Offender Specialist and worked with women and battery cases. I was going to make a difference, this seemed a great place to start. Around this time, and in answer to Zoreh’s question, I founded Wounded Wings: Association for the Betterment of Women and Girls. Wounded Wings serves survivors of sexual and domestic abuse and also supports women entrepreneurs. After a few years with Wounded Wings, I returned to Alverno to enhance my skills to become a better leader. I earned a Master’s in Education with an emphasis on Organizational Development.

In 2019, I earned a Master’s of the Arts in Pastoral Studies at Cardinal Stritch University . While my earlier degrees were for career pursuits, this one was for God. My time at Stritch helped me to evolve as a Christian and develop an inclusive view of faith and religion. Working for Wisconsin I am a graduate of The White House Project , a non-partisan group training women to run for office. I am a lifelong Democrat, but independent voter. I don’t support party politics and . While too young to vote, I helped to get out the vote for President Clinton’s first Presidential Election. I have actively canvassed and supported candidates ever since. I was honored to represent Dodge County as a delegate at state convention.
