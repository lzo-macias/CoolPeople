Home Royal Communication(s) About Connect With Me SI Pat’s parade boss in scuffle A St. Patrick’s Day Parade official yesterday clashed with a marcher over gay rights at Staten Island’s annual event — where Mayor Bloomberg was heckled and later criticized for even making an appearance. St. Jermaine Endeley, a New York University student, was marching with the Young Democrats of Richmond County when he started getting hassled by parade honcho Dennis McKeon over a lapel pin that Endeley was wearing in support of a gay and lesbian group not allowed to march. Video footage shows Endeley — one of 20 group members in the parade — carrying an American flag and sporting a stamp-sized fabric rainbow pinned to his lapel. McKeon, 70, is then seen repeatedly trying to block his path and push him off course. “I told him this is America and that I have the right to wear whatever I want,” Endeley said. “First, he grabbed my shirt and tried to rough me up. I tried to slap his hands away. Then he tried to rip my ribbon off, and I wouldn’t let him do that.” McKeon insists the Young Democrats were trying to sneak gay people into the march and denies pushing Endeley. “If they weren’t gay, what were they doing marching with ribbons?” he said. “[The Young Democrats] chose to bring gays into the march with them. That went against the regulations of the parade.” The group that the Young Democrats were supporting, Staten Island Pride Events, was not banned from the parade, but barred from carrying a banner, according to parade committee President James Haynes. One source said McKeon’s daughter is Lorraine McKeon Scanni, co-founder of the Staten Island Tea Party. The Young Democrats had asked parade organizers to ban the Tea Party from marching, thinking political groups weren’t allowed. But parade bigs said such organizations were welcome. Meanwhile, the mayor was heckled over looming city-worker layoffs, as well as for making a joke several weeks ago about Irish drunkenness at the Irish-American Historical Society. He also was criticized for attending the Staten Island parade because of the gay-rights issue.

Home Royal Communication(s) About Connect With Me Following In His Family’s Historic Legacy, Saint Jermaine Endeley Is A Wall Street Investor & Entrepreneur Who Pioneered West Africa Securities – A Global Private Equity Firm Saint Jermaine is the CEO of West Africa Securities , Inc. He lives his life and runs his business in a similar manner: always keeping in mind that money is not the end all be all to life, but merely something on the side. “Like many other African-American Entrepreneurs, I live a humble, modest, and frugal lifestyle everyday. I have many theories on labor, money, and the economy. To keep it simple- my guiding principle is that life has many opportunities that have no monetary value whatsoever because of how the Earth is naturally ordered according to science. So what I want people reading this to take away is: “Do not live a life solely based on money, do not try to force the universe into your life plan, try and take things one step and one day at a time. Be glad everyday you wake up because it is another chance to rinse and repeat.”’ Saint explains. Inspired by his grandfather and father, Saint got into the industry to follow in their footsteps. His business has been incredibly successful. Perhaps it is his entrepreneurial genes or his hard work ethic that helped him rise to the top, but he is not slowing down any time soon. “The amazing legacy of my Grandfather Francis G. Endeley (a British trained Civil Engineer) and the natural tendency to want to be like my father Henry W. Endeley (a U.K trained international Solicitor) gave me the early foundation to get started in business. West Africa Securities, Inc. is an international private equity firm. Saint Jermaine Endeley’s investment record began in 2003 when Mr. Endeley was only 13 years old. In 2016 Mr. Endeley entered into an ISDA Agreement with Berkshire Hathaway, Inc (NYSE:BRK-A/B). Today he serves in the Office of Finance as an Assistant Director during the day while privately administering three businesses as an Entrepreneur. This does not mean that Saint’s career was completely without obstacles. Like with many other entrepreneurs, Saint needed a lot of access to information, which he did not always have. This led to many difficulties when beginning his work. “The biggest obstacle I have had to overcome in my career is access to information. Because of the nature of my business, I don’t always have all the information I need to form a professional opinion. Because of the nature of Wall Street and the “lifecycle of securities” most investors are subject to life long learning and discovery of information. This is the reality. I think it is an obstacle that must be addressed,” Saint recounts. Saint has a lot of great plans in the coming months. His biggest plan this year is finalizing plans for a housing development on Stapleton Waterfront Site A. For 2021, he has even bigger plans to keep his business moving despite the challenges that the pandemic world faces. “My flagship project for the rest of the year until Christmas is to finalize a plan for the development of Stapleton Waterfront site A in Staten Island that is being developed by the Department of Housing & Preservation and the City of New York. West Africa Securities is interested in this project for many reasons. The main reason and mission of the firm is to support the City of New York in making Stapleton Waterfront site A the most prolific and progressive affordable housing development in New York City history. We plan on using our financial capacity to compete and negotiate the most equitable deal for the residents of Staten Island who have been waiting for affordable housing for generations.

    "text": "SAGBAMA ROYAL is the leadership of all African people. Home Royal Communication(s) About Connect With Me How Private Equity Investment Can Grow Your Business Private equity investment is a great source of funding for any business that wants to grow from its breakeven phase at launch to viable profitability. Every business owner desires growth, but getting sufficient capital at times to achieve this goal can be challenging. At other times, linear growth may not be necessary, but diversification in product range or resource improvement could require additional cash. Private equity investors are the people to explore for that added cash you need to inject in your business. They will bring on board technical support, fresh business ideas to spur growth and the cash. Positive impact on value Private equity investors are usually experts in their fields of investment and bring this vast business knowledge to your company. Their level of professionalism and reputation will have a positive impact on the profile of your business through association. This, in turn, generates greater trust and elevates the value of your company. Unlike salaried managers, private equity investors have a stake in your company and insist on proper governance systems for improved performance. Your company stands to gain from their wealth of experience and expertise and you can move on to other ventures with better business understanding. Minority stakeholder protection When your business is a partnership with bigger shareholders, you could risk giving up some of your rights. The big shareholders may also force managers on you and increase costs when not necessary. You need someone with enough muscle to keep the big boys in check. A reputable private equity investor can bring in “an honest broker between all interests” as Mr. Saint Jermaine Endeley of the Count Consulting Group puts it. Private equity investors always strive to protect their turf against hostile interference. Expansion and recap When you run out of funding options at the apex of your company’s growth, you may consider private equity investors. This option will put at your disposal funds for expansion , new product lines, and branch opening. The investor will also come with fresh business ideas to improve your operations as you grow. If, on the other hand, your business is struggling, you could use some funds to recapitalize. As long as your business demonstrates potential, private equity investors will be happy to partner with you for a fresh start. Reduction of agency costs Employing agents to manage your business presents challenges that eventually increase operating costs. Besides high spending on internal audits and salaries, there is also the inconvenience of working out solutions for divergent interests that may not appeal to principals. The level of commitment to the success of the company may not be as high for a paid manager as it is for an investor with a stake in the business. Private equity investors prefer a hands-on management model that not only serves the business well but also cuts salary costs. These investors will work with your interests at heart as they also share expertise with you. Improve and sell If you are a restless spirit in the business world, you will not be likely to stay long in one venture. You are always looking towards new frontiers and diversify the business opportunities as soon as you establish one. This means that you have an overflowing reservoir of business ideas and you can turn these into mega dollars. A good idea would be to set up a viable business and invite private equity investors to improve and buy you out at a profit. This is a much simpler, faster, and more lucrative option than listings and IPOs.

    "text": "SAGBAMA ROYAL is the leadership of all African people. Home Royal Communication(s) About Connect With Me How Private Equity Investment Can Grow Your Business Private equity investment is a great source of funding for any business that wants to grow from its breakeven phase at launch to viable profitability. Every business owner desires growth, but getting sufficient capital at times to achieve this goal can be challenging. At other times, linear growth may not be necessary, but diversification in product range or resource improvement could require additional cash. Private equity investors are the people to explore for that added cash you need to inject in your business. They will bring on board technical support, fresh business ideas to spur growth and the cash. Positive impact on value Private equity investors are usually experts in their fields of investment and bring this vast business knowledge to your company. Their level of professionalism and reputation will have a positive impact on the profile of your business through association. This, in turn, generates greater trust and elevates the value of your company. Unlike salaried managers, private equity investors have a stake in your company and insist on proper governance systems for improved performance. Your company stands to gain from their wealth of experience and expertise and you can move on to other ventures with better business understanding. Minority stakeholder protection When your business is a partnership with bigger shareholders, you could risk giving up some of your rights. The big shareholders may also force managers on you and increase costs when not necessary. You need someone with enough muscle to keep the big boys in check. A reputable private equity investor can bring in “an honest broker between all interests” as Mr. Saint Jermaine Endeley of the Count Consulting Group puts it. Private equity investors always strive to protect their turf against hostile interference. Expansion and recap When you run out of funding options at the apex of your company’s growth, you may consider private equity investors. This option will put at your disposal funds for expansion , new product lines, and branch opening. The investor will also come with fresh business ideas to improve your operations as you grow. If, on the other hand, your business is struggling, you could use some funds to recapitalize. As long as your business demonstrates potential, private equity investors will be happy to partner with you for a fresh start. Reduction of agency costs Employing agents to manage your business presents challenges that eventually increase operating costs. Besides high spending on internal audits and salaries, there is also the inconvenience of working out solutions for divergent interests that may not appeal to principals. The level of commitment to the success of the company may not be as high for a paid manager as it is for an investor with a stake in the business. Private equity investors prefer a hands-on management model that not only serves the business well but also cuts salary costs. These investors will work with your interests at heart as they also share expertise with you. Improve and sell If you are a restless spirit in the business world, you will not be likely to stay long in one venture. You are always looking towards new frontiers and diversify the business opportunities as soon as you establish one. This means that you have an overflowing reservoir of business ideas and you can turn these into mega dollars. A good idea would be to set up a viable business and invite private equity investors to improve and buy you out at a profit. This is a much simpler, faster, and more lucrative option than listings and IPOs.

Diane Savino (D-North Shore/Brooklyn). And this time the West Brighton resident means it. Saint Jermaine Endeley, 21, said he decided to drop out of the race after meeting with Democrats and with residents and community leaders in the 23rd Senate District. “After weighing heavily the viability of my candidacy I have decided not to run for State Senate in 2012,” Endeley said in a statement released by his campaign. “While I hope to see the Senate Democrats united and to have my ideas promoted in Albany, I simply do not believe that I can win at this time and so I will instead focus my energy on other projects.” Endeley, a New York University student who played football on Curtis High School’s undefeated 2008 squad, said he wanted to run in order to stop NYPD stop-and-frisk procedures and to fight for independent legislative redistricting. He also wanted to help reunite the Senate Democratic conference. Ms. Savino is part of the four-person breakaway Independent Democratic Conference. “And I wanted to run because I felt that the people of the 23rd district deserve minority and youth representation in Albany,” Endeley said. Endeley had initially announced a run last year, but it was then reported that he was dropping out of the race. However, Endeley at that time insisted he was staying in. But this time he said he is definitely not running. But Endeley, a member of the Young Democrats, added that he is not leaving politics. Advance file photo State Sen. Diane Savino “I do not regret this endeavor and I fully intend to continue to be active both in my community and in Democratic politics,” he said.” I will continue to encourage young people to get involved and to seek elected office.” Said Endeley, “Make no mistake, I’m not saying good bye, but merely, see you later.” Ms. Savino said she had no hard feelings about the short-lived challenge. “He’s a smart young man,” she said. “He has a great future ahead of him, and I want him to stay involved in politics and in his community. I never take anything personally.” Prev Prev Previous Saint Jermaine interview with NYU Local. Previous Saint Jermaine interview with NYU Local.

According to the New York Post, “St. Jermaine Endeley, a New York University student, was marching with the Young Democrats of Richmond County when he started getting hassled by parade honcho Dennis McKeon over a lapel pin that Endeley was wearing in support of a gay and lesbian group not allowed to march.” McKeon denied pushing Endeley and insisted that the group was trying to “sneak” gay people into the march, according to the Post. His daughter, Lorraine McKeon Scanni, is reported to be a cofounder of the Staten Island Tea Party. The Young Democrats marched in solidarity with the group Staten Island Pride Events, which was effectively rendered invisible this year because of a ban on gay pride signage. Such displays have long been banned from the larger St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Manhattan that many local elected officials already boycott. Citywide elected officials including city council speaker Christine Quinn, who is a lesbian, condemned the latest ban on Sunday at a press conference before the inclusive St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Queens.

Home Royal Communication(s) About Connect With Me Gay Pride Banned From New York St. Pat’s Parade Officials from the St. Patrick’s Day Parade in New York’s Staten Island borough clashed with at least one marcher who attempted to display gay pride Sunday in violation of discriminatory new parade regulations. According to the New York Post, “St. Jermaine Endeley, a New York University student, was marching with the Young Democrats of Richmond County when he started getting hassled by parade honcho Dennis McKeon over a lapel pin that Endeley was wearing in support of a gay and lesbian group not allowed to march.” McKeon denied pushing Endeley and insisted that the group was trying to “sneak” gay people into the march, according to the Post. His daughter, Lorraine McKeon Scanni, is reported to be a cofounder of the Staten Island Tea Party. The Young Democrats marched in solidarity with the group Staten Island Pride Events, which was effectively rendered invisible this year because of a ban on gay pride signage. Such displays have long been banned from the larger St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Manhattan that many local elected officials already boycott. Citywide elected officials including city council speaker Christine Quinn, who is a lesbian, condemned the latest ban on Sunday at a press conference before the inclusive St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Queens.

Abstract Youth homelessness is a growing crisis impacting urban high schools across the United States. Black youth, in particular, are disproportionately affected. While the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act is designed to provide educational access to students experiencing homelessness, the extent to which the policy supports Black students is unclear. This qualitative study uses structural racism as an analytic framework to examine the narratives of eight Black youth who successfully graduated high school while experiencing homelessness. Findings show that being Black and experiencing homelessness creates unique challenges for accessing resources under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Participants identified hostile racial climates at school as a common deterrent from disclosing their homeless status to adults at school, thereby restricting their access to federal support. The findings suggest the need for race-conscious language and interventions to be included in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Additionally, the author urges more researchers studying youth homelessness to use a critical racial lens to address the racial knowledge gap that exists in the current literature on student homelessness.

Abstract Youth homelessness is a growing crisis impacting urban high schools across the United States. Black youth, in particular, are disproportionately affected. While the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act is designed to provide educational access to students experiencing homelessness, the extent to which the policy supports Black students is unclear. This qualitative study uses structural racism as an analytic framework to examine the narratives of eight Black youth who successfully graduated high school while experiencing homelessness. Findings show that being Black and experiencing homelessness creates unique challenges for accessing resources under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Participants identified hostile racial climates at school as a common deterrent from disclosing their homeless status to adults at school, thereby restricting their access to federal support. The findings suggest the need for race-conscious language and interventions to be included in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.

Saint Jermaine Endeley is a 21-year-old NYU student, and he’s running for the Democratic nomination for the State Senate seat in Staten Island and Brooklyn. A self-described “pro-business Democrat” and creator of a his own 5–5–5 economic stimulus plan , Endeley’s taking a farther right stance than opponent, 4-term incumbent Democrat Sen. Diane Savino. As of the night of December 12th, his Facebook is up to 56 likes (it was at 15 last week ), and he is sporting three times as many fuzzy profile pictures as before. We e-mailed Endeley about his campaign, balancing NYU, and dining halls. He responded with two LOLs and a press release. What made you decide to run now? Well I simply felt like the time was now. I am looking at the way politicians behave today and it honestly makes me sick sometimes. There are so many important issues to be dealt with and here we are fighting over petty politics in both Washington and Albany. Politicians cannot even pass budgets and government can’t pay it’s bills. You see members of Congress insider trading and Governors selling U.S Senate seats. I feel like the last generation has dealt 90’s babies tough cards to play and we do not have many options. And I feel like a generational change in all levels of government might be what is necessary to restore some sense of responsibility. Do you think your age or student status will be a factor going forward in the campaign? I think it will for some folks. I think it will be a positive factor for others. I am not the only young person in NYC politics who has successfully run for office. You have Eric Ulrich of Queens who was 23. David Carlucci upstate who was 22. And even Teddy Roosevelt was 18. I think if I have the issues and facts on my side I’ll be okay. Plus it’s my hometown, everyone knows me from my high school years. I’ve read that the incumbent, Sen. Diane Savino, has a deep fundraising bank. How are you planning on competing with that? It will be hard. Going against any incumbent is hard. But I cannot let that discourage or intimate me. [Note: in a later e-mail, Endeley said he meant “intimidate.”] I am going to have to see if grass roots and small dollar fundraising can still get the job done in the age of “Citizens United”. I think with the power of social media and good public policy, I can encourage people that I will be a better choice. But she will no doubt raise way more money than me. Unless NYU students want to help me raise small donations? LOL Why are you running to the right of Savino? Well thats just where I am on the issues. I will let the media determine if it is the right or left. I am no doubt a pro business Democrat. I think you would have to be crazy not to be in this economy. I am naturally a fiscal conservative- I think government should live within it’s means. People are going to label me as anti Labor but that is not true. How could I be when my mom is in a labor union that is the reason she is still even employed. I just think sometimes they over reach on policy issues here in NYC and I only want to be an honest broker between all interests. I also think government should be efficient and limited to a certain extent. However I do believe government has a role to play in economics and solving the hardships of poverty. There just has to be a mutual responsibility between society and the individual. I occupied Wall street because their culture of greed crashed the economy and some still do not take full responsibility. But I do not think we should end, over regulate, or over tax America’s economic engine. I just think there needs to be some new rules of the road. Not only for wall Street but for everybody. Why should we vote for you? Im not sure how many of you live in my district but you should help campaign LOL. I say that because my election is more significant than me or even the policies I believe in. It is about a generational frustration with how politics"

I am the most honest politician you can choose from. How can you campaign and be an NYU student at the same time? I wont be. I took a leave of absence and will return if I lose. If I win, I can also still finish- I’m not that far from graduation. The position is technically part-time. Most members of the New York Legislature make millions running businesses and law firms when they are not in session. If they can do that, I think I can handle a few courses here and there until I’m done. Last question: Upstein or Downstein? YOU MUST DECIDE. Upstein dude. Who can deny Chik-Fil-A… Later, he e-mailed us a press release, noting various disappointments with Cuomo’s money distribution and the lack of attendence of Sen. Savino at regional economic distribution meetings. However, he does have big dreams for Staten Island: “We could use a nice Imax Theater in St. George among many other development ideas on the table for the north shore. I am glad we got the park in Fresh Kills. I can’t wait to take a jog in the summer and go out for a kayak with my friends.” Endeley also hopes for the legalization of “non-Indian Casinos and outer borough pick ups for livery cabs” as both are great for the NYC economy.
