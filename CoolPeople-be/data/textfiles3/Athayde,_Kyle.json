Photo: Harrison Linsey Kyle Athayde is a San Francisco Bay Area based composer, arranger, performer, teacher, and bandleader. A native of Orinda, California, Kyle primarily plays vibraphone, piano, trumpet, and drums, as well as bongo, congas, timbales, string bass, bass clarinet, sousaphone, and vocal percussion. He is the leader, conductor, and principal writer for the San Francisco/New York based big band, \"Kyle Athayde Dance Party\", a group acclaimed for its versatility in the wide scope of styles it performs. He is also the composer and arranger for Eddie Barbash’s double quartet, as well as a member of the Nate Sparks Big Band, the Jon Hatamiya Big Band and Nonet, Ryan DeWeese’s RADJazz Orchestra. Influenced by the music of J. S. Bach, Duke Ellington, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Eric Dolphy, Dmitri Shostakovich, Louis Armstrong, Igor Stravinsky, Charlie Parker, Olivier Messiaen, Art Tatum, and many others, Athayde composes and arranges music in a variety of genres, with an emphasis on jazz, classical, salsa, and electronic. While an undergraduate student at Juilliard, Kyle was heavily immersed in an inter-disciplinary arts environment which included dance, drama, and music, which provided him the opportunity to further develop and refine his programmatic approach to composition. Athayde’s recent commissioned compositions and premieres include a double concerto for the New York Sinfonietta, a tone poem for Bobby Sanabria and The Manhattan School of Music Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra (the title track of their most recent album, ¡QUE VIVA HARLEM!), and music for the ending credits of the film \"Diller, Scofidio + Renfro: Reimagining Lincoln Center and the High Line.\" He also arranged the music for the halftime show for the University of California at Berkeley Marching Band in their final performance of the 2013 season. Kyle has also written commissions for the Canadian Brass, The New York Trumpet Ensemble, Manhattan School of Music Trumpet Ensemble, The University of Scranton, and the San Francisco Conservatory Brass Choir. Committed to inter-disciplinary educational outreach in the arts, Kyle has offered classes, clinics, lessons and masterclasses at schools, workshops, and camps in California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Alaska. A regular visiting faculty member of the Sitka Fine Arts Camp, he developed and taught classes on video game music, vocal hip hop, and jazz bands. He is the Director of Curriculum at the Lafayette Summer Music Workshop, and regularly offers clinics and masterclasses to middle school and high school bands throughout Northern California. Kyle has a wide range of interests, and loves to teach and learn about a variety of subjects, which brings a wide stylistic variety to his music, as his diverse interests inspire his work. A passionate fan of American football, the ruthless power and strategy of the sport influence his exciting writing style. An avid gamer, the music of these games has inspired some of his most unusual and engaging compositions. Individual band member bios coming soon!

As your City Council Member, I will reform the shelter system to require on-site services including mental health support, healthcare, childcare, and workforce development, audit shelter operators to ensure funds are properly used, expand assisted outpatient treatment (Kendra’s Law), and create a public review process for any shelter siting. SAFETY + COMPASSION SAFETY + COMPASSION Our streets, subways, and small businesses need to be safe from crime. As your City Council Member, I will ensure that the NYPD is a dynamic force for safety and unity - one that anticipates threats, addresses root causes, and builds trust with communities. PROTECT THE UES PROTECT THE UES I oppose Northwell’s $2.5 billion, 11-year, 436-foot tower project in the middle of the Upper East Side. Any development must be responsible development in partnership with the local community. As your Council Member, I will continue to support and amplify the grassroots efforts of Upper East Side residents to reject this plan, and instead support the improvement of the current facility.

Largely absent from this turn to respectability, however, is engagement with the criminal law, particularly in cases where queers cannot be easily read as the victims of crime. Given the longstanding conflation between queerness and criminality in Anglo-American legal discourse, this is an unexpected development in Canada, where events including the partial decriminalization of homosexuality (1969) and the Toronto Bathhouse Raids (1981) served to mobilize communities and laid the foundation for the contemporary queer rights movement. Law and Order Queers: Respectability, Victimhood, and the Carceral State weaves together practices of policing on the street, narratives about HIV non-disclosure from the courtroom, and the experiences of people in prison to tell a new story about queer rights in Canada. Drawing on original empirical research, this project argues that when queer people become ensnared in the repressive aspects of criminal justice, the contemporary legal system stops addressing the hardships they face due to their sexual and gender identities. While norms of substantive equality are now well entrenched in the fields of human rights law, family law, and constitutional law, these standards are cast aside when it comes to the administration of punishment. The project concludes by developing a theory of the law and order queer movement, arguing that when queer people code themselves as respectable victims of crime seeking protection from the punitive apparatuses of the carceral state, they run the risk of instantiating law and order agendas. As a result, they may inadvertently breathe new life into systems that continue to be used to discipline the most vulnerable members of queer communities. Ultimately, Law and Order Queers challenges the conventional narrative that Canada, unlike other countries around the word, no longer criminalizes queer people. Rather, the project demonstrates that the same queer legal subjects who failed to benefit from the promise of human rights protections, same-sex benefits, and marriage equality continue to find themselves targeted by the carceral state.

Law and Order Queers Law and Order Queers: Respectability, Victimhood, and the Carceral State Under contract, UBC Press Abstract Over the past three decades, debates in Canada surrounding the introduction of human rights protections, benefits for same-sex couples, and relationship recognition have tended to invoke a new queer legal subject, one draped in the garb of respectability. Largely absent from this turn to respectability, however, is engagement with the criminal law, particularly in cases where queers cannot be easily read as the victims of crime. Given the longstanding conflation between queerness and criminality in Anglo-American legal discourse, this is an unexpected development in Canada, where events including the partial decriminalization of homosexuality (1969) and the Toronto Bathhouse Raids (1981) served to mobilize communities and laid the foundation for the contemporary queer rights movement. Law and Order Queers: Respectability, Victimhood, and the Carceral State weaves together practices of policing on the street, narratives about HIV non-disclosure from the courtroom, and the experiences of people in prison to tell a new story about queer rights in Canada. Drawing on original empirical research, this project argues that when queer people become ensnared in the repressive aspects of criminal justice, the contemporary legal system stops addressing the hardships they face due to their sexual and gender identities. While norms of substantive equality are now well entrenched in the fields of human rights law, family law, and constitutional law, these standards are cast aside when it comes to the administration of punishment.

Meet the owners Tony C's Pizza & Beer Garden opened at Kohler's Crossing in November . Owners and Austin natives Tony Ciola and Creed Ford met in the 2000's when Ciola was working at his family’s Italian restaurant in Lakeway. Ciola’s, now a location of The League Kitchen & Tavern , was an ode to the family’s first restaurant in Virginia Beach in 1949, Ciola said. Ciola and Ford opened their first joint venture, Tony C's Coal Fired Pizza , in Bee Cave in 2009. Two years later, they founded their restaurant group Tc4 & Co. , combining their shared restaurant industry experience. “We had a mutual passion for the restaurant business but had grown up at opposite ends of the spectrum where I was in the family-owned and operated side of business and Creed had been running finance and marketing on the national restaurant chain side of the business,” Ciola said. Tc4 & Co.’s brands include Mighty Fine Burgers, Fries & Shakes ; The League Kitchen & Tavern; Tony C's Coal Fired Pizza, Tony C’s Pizza & Beer Garden and the newly opened Cousin Louie’s in Dripping Springs . Ford and his family also opened Rudy’s Country Store & Bar-B-Q in Kyle last year . What they offer Ford said Tony C’s Pizza & Beer Garden concept came from a trend they saw in fast-casual counter service restaurants. “You can have a business meeting there in business casual or you could bring your kids in after a game in their soccer uniforms,” Ford said. They also looked to model the space after outdoor dining spaces in New York City. Ciola said they hit about 20 pizza joints there to get menu inspiration. “When we opened Tony C’s [Coal Fired Pizza], we leveraged a lot of the Italian-American recipes that our family grew up making, but we never really grew up making pizza,” Ciola said. “So that's when we went to New York and discovered that what we felt was the best representation of New York-style pizza.” The beer garden menu focuses more on handmade coal-fired pizza with fresh ingredients. It also offers appetizers, wings, salads and Italian sub sandwiches. Tony C’s in Kyle, the brand’s first standalone location, features communal picnic-style tables, TVs, a covered patio and beer and wine on tap. Staying local With multiple Tc4 & Co. restaurants now open in Kyle, Ciola and Ford said they look forward to growing with the community. “We've got a nice corner on I-35 and Kohler’s Crossing, where we put two of our brands, Tony C’s and Mighty Fine...” Ciola said. “So just seeing the opportunity that, if we didn't take it, someone else would, and just having that pride of being local and wanting to expand our brands as Austin expands.” 2344 Kohlers Crossing, Kyle 2344 Kohlers Crossing, Kyle www.tonycsbeergarden.com www.tonycsbeergarden.com 1700 Kohlers Crossing Kyle, Texas 78640 512-262-3932 Email Us Be the first to learn about the latest in Kyle. ©2025 Kyle, TX Economic Development.

Meet the owners Tony C's Pizza & Beer Garden opened at Kohler's Crossing in November . Owners and Austin natives Tony Ciola and Creed Ford met in the 2000's when Ciola was working at his family’s Italian restaurant in Lakeway. Ciola’s, now a location of The League Kitchen & Tavern , was an ode to the family’s first restaurant in Virginia Beach in 1949, Ciola said. Ciola and Ford opened their first joint venture, Tony C's Coal Fired Pizza , in Bee Cave in 2009. Two years later, they founded their restaurant group Tc4 & Co. , combining their shared restaurant industry experience. “We had a mutual passion for the restaurant business but had grown up at opposite ends of the spectrum where I was in the family-owned and operated side of business and Creed had been running finance and marketing on the national restaurant chain side of the business,” Ciola said. Tc4 & Co.’s brands include Mighty Fine Burgers, Fries & Shakes ; The League Kitchen & Tavern; Tony C's Coal Fired Pizza, Tony C’s Pizza & Beer Garden and the newly opened Cousin Louie’s in Dripping Springs . Ford and his family also opened Rudy’s Country Store & Bar-B-Q in Kyle last year . What they offer Ford said Tony C’s Pizza & Beer Garden concept came from a trend they saw in fast-casual counter service restaurants. “You can have a business meeting there in business casual or you could bring your kids in after a game in their soccer uniforms,” Ford said. They also looked to model the space after outdoor dining spaces in New York City. Ciola said they hit about 20 pizza joints there to get menu inspiration. “When we opened Tony C’s [Coal Fired Pizza], we leveraged a lot of the Italian-American recipes that our family grew up making, but we never really grew up making pizza,” Ciola said. “So that's when we went to New York and discovered that what we felt was the best representation of New York-style pizza.” The beer garden menu focuses more on handmade coal-fired pizza with fresh ingredients. It also offers appetizers, wings, salads and Italian sub sandwiches. Tony C’s in Kyle, the brand’s first standalone location, features communal picnic-style tables, TVs, a covered patio and beer and wine on tap. Staying local With multiple Tc4 & Co. restaurants now open in Kyle, Ciola and Ford said they look forward to growing with the community. “We've got a nice corner on I-35 and Kohler’s Crossing, where we put two of our brands, Tony C’s and Mighty Fine...” Ciola said. “So just seeing the opportunity that, if we didn't take it, someone else would, and just having that pride of being local and wanting to expand our brands as Austin expands.” 2344 Kohlers Crossing, Kyle 2344 Kohlers Crossing, Kyle www.tonycsbeergarden.com www.tonycsbeergarden.com 1700 Kohlers Crossing Kyle, Texas 78640 512-262-3932 Email Us Be the first to learn about the latest in Kyle. ©2025 Kyle, TX Economic Development.

Kyle enjoys strategic positioning along the bustling I-35 corridor, nestled between two of Texas' top-performing cities. Situated just 7 miles south of Austin's city limits and a mere 39 miles north of San Antonio's boundaries, Kyle occupies a prime location along this thriving corridor, perfectly positioned to harness the benefits of rapid growth. Twenty years ago, standing at the corner of I-35 & FM 1626, you would have seen only cow pastures as far as the eye could see. Kyle did not even have a grocery store. For many years our city was growing, but we were at most a bedroom community to Austin. But now that all has changed. Within an extremely short period of time , Kyle has undergone a dramatic transformation, thanks to investment and commitment from commercial businesses and developers. Today, Kyle has approximately 2.5 million square feet of retail/mixed use space currently at the intersection of I-35 and FM 1626 alone. There is an additional 900,000 square feet at FM 1626 and Kohlers Crossing, and an additional 800,000 square feet of retail/mixed use space at the Dry River District at Exit 215. There are also several other planned developments in the works. . The City of Kyle is poised to be the largest city in Hays County. Our population multiplied many times over since the 2000 census from 5,000 citizens to over 62,500 . Several factors prove the area is very progressive, including transportation, utility and water plans, access, and construction. The City of Kyle is currently undergoing major infrastructure improvements and with an average 22% yearly sales tax increase , the city is continually reinvesting in its future. We strongly encourage you to begin or continue your Central Texas search here in Kyle. 1700 Kohlers Crossing Kyle, Texas 78640 512-262-3932 Email Us Be the first to learn about the latest in Kyle. ©2025 Kyle, TX Economic Development.

After reviewing schematic designs at their Jan. 21 meeting, Kyle City Council directed SPA Skateparks to continue designing a skatepark at Gregg-Clarke Park. Gregg-Clarke Park, located at 1231 W. Center St. in Kyle, will hold the new skatepark as it has a large lot of empty land. (Jamie Moore/Community Impact) The overview After reviewing three options, the council recommended a design contract with SPA Skateparks for an all-wheels skatepark, featuring a pump track, flow bowl and skate plaza. Individuals with various skill levels and different types of wheels can use the pump track. The surface may vary, with options including a soft surface, concrete or asphalt. The all-wheels approach will allow use by skateboarders, scooter riders, cyclists and wheelchair users, according to the City Council presentation . “When I first saw all-wheels, I was thinking about the bikes ... the skateboards ... the scooters—I never even fathomed about wheelchairs,” council member Robert Rizo said. “I mean giving everybody the opportunity should be what we do as a city, so it’s really important that we think of everyone when we’re thinking about our parks and our projects. Making sure that those that are bound to a wheelchair can participate and will be able to use this is really amazing.” The proposed skatepark will be 28,000 to 34,000 square feet. The square footage of each project in the skatepark includes: Skate plaza zone: 12,000 to 14,000 square feet Skate plaza zone: 12,000 to 14,000 square feet Flow bowl zone: 6,000 to 8,000 square feet Flow bowl zone: 6,000 to 8,000 square feet Pump track: 10,000 to 12,000 square feet Pump track: 10,000 to 12,000 square feet The project includes eliminating the existing tennis court, which according to the presentation, requires repair. The new potential skatepark in Gregg-Clarke park is going to be built over the current tennis court, which is in need of repair. (Jamie Moore/Community Impact) The total cost of this option is estimated at $3.4 million, with $3.1 million allocated for construction and $325,500 for design fees. The project will be funded in part by a 2020 bond and available Capital Improvement Plan funds. The City Council presentation also describes the process of the project. The phases include: Phase 1: Execute the contract to provide two schematic options with cost estimates. Phase 1: Execute the contract to provide two schematic options with cost estimates. Phase 2: Pending direction, execute the contract for design development to consider the final render for adoption.

Phase 3: Pending approval of final render, execute contract to finalize construction plans and construction. Phase 1 was completed at the Jan. 21 council meeting. Digging deeper If approved, the skatepark will become the fifth-largest in Texas, according to the City Council presentation. Additionally, Kyle's skatepark will be one of only five in Texas to feature an all-wheels approach with an integrated pump track. The background In November 2020, Kyle residents approved a $1 million park bond for Gregg-Clarke Park. The City Council later approved a $1 million interlocal agreement with Hays County to match the bond funding, according to the City Council presentation . SPA Skateparks was awarded a contract in February 2023, and early"

After reviewing schematic designs at their Jan. 21 meeting, Kyle City Council directed SPA Skateparks to continue designing a skatepark at Gregg-Clarke Park. Gregg-Clarke Park, located at 1231 W. Center St. in Kyle, will hold the new skatepark as it has a large lot of empty land. (Jamie Moore/Community Impact) The overview After reviewing three options, the council recommended a design contract with SPA Skateparks for an all-wheels skatepark, featuring a pump track, flow bowl and skate plaza. Individuals with various skill levels and different types of wheels can use the pump track. The surface may vary, with options including a soft surface, concrete or asphalt. The all-wheels approach will allow use by skateboarders, scooter riders, cyclists and wheelchair users, according to the City Council presentation . “When I first saw all-wheels, I was thinking about the bikes ... the skateboards ... the scooters—I never even fathomed about wheelchairs,” council member Robert Rizo said. “I mean giving everybody the opportunity should be what we do as a city, so it’s really important that we think of everyone when we’re thinking about our parks and our projects. Making sure that those that are bound to a wheelchair can participate and will be able to use this is really amazing.” The proposed skatepark will be 28,000 to 34,000 square feet. The square footage of each project in the skatepark includes: Skate plaza zone: 12,000 to 14,000 square feet Skate plaza zone: 12,000 to 14,000 square feet Flow bowl zone: 6,000 to 8,000 square feet Flow bowl zone: 6,000 to 8,000 square feet Pump track: 10,000 to 12,000 square feet Pump track: 10,000 to 12,000 square feet The project includes eliminating the existing tennis court, which according to the presentation, requires repair. The new potential skatepark in Gregg-Clarke park is going to be built over the current tennis court, which is in need of repair. (Jamie Moore/Community Impact) The total cost of this option is estimated at $3.4 million, with $3.1 million allocated for construction and $325,500 for design fees. The project will be funded in part by a 2020 bond and available Capital Improvement Plan funds. The City Council presentation also describes the process of the project. The phases include: Phase 1: Execute the contract to provide two schematic options with cost estimates. Phase 1: Execute the contract to provide two schematic options with cost estimates.

New information shows that one restaurant chain known nationwide for its wings is the latest to follow other chains into a popular Texas town. Gone are the days of Kyle being a sleepy Austin suburb. The Pie Capital of Texas has been adding more and more big name brands move into town and now Buffalo Wild Wings is the latest food spot to enter the boomtown. Buffalo Wild Wings, the Georgia-based wing chain with over 1,200 restaurants worldwide, is planning to build its first eatery in Kyle along the booming I-35 corridor. The chain is planning a year-long build out on the $1.7 million wing hut with construction expected to start on April 1 and be completed by April 1, 2026, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation . Buffalo Wild Wings, or B-Dubs, is known for its variety of chicken wings — with traditional and bone-less options — with sauces ranging from sweet bbq to blazin'. The chain is a popular destination for watching sports from the Super Bowl to the World Series and even UFC fight nights. Kyle is the second restaurant announced for the I-35 corridor. Wild Wings is also planning to open its first restaurant in San Marcos . While there are multiple BWWs in Austin and San Antonio, its clear the space between the metros is the current hot bed for sports foodies. The 5,500-square-foot-restaurant is the latest in a number of businesses moving in, such as Waffle House and Hays County Bar-B-Q. Even more should be on the way once the $250 million Vybe District Park is completed.

New information shows that one restaurant chain known nationwide for its wings is the latest to follow other chains into a popular Texas town. Gone are the days of Kyle being a sleepy Austin suburb. The Pie Capital of Texas has been adding more and more big name brands move into town and now Buffalo Wild Wings is the latest food spot to enter the boomtown. Buffalo Wild Wings, the Georgia-based wing chain with over 1,200 restaurants worldwide, is planning to build its first eatery in Kyle along the booming I-35 corridor. The chain is planning a year-long build out on the $1.7 million wing hut with construction expected to start on April 1 and be completed by April 1, 2026, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation . Buffalo Wild Wings, or B-Dubs, is known for its variety of chicken wings — with traditional and bone-less options — with sauces ranging from sweet bbq to blazin'. The chain is a popular destination for watching sports from the Super Bowl to the World Series and even UFC fight nights. Kyle is the second restaurant announced for the I-35 corridor. Wild Wings is also planning to open its first restaurant in San Marcos . While there are multiple BWWs in Austin and San Antonio, its clear the space between the metros is the current hot bed for sports foodies. The 5,500-square-foot-restaurant is the latest in a number of businesses moving in, such as Waffle House and Hays County Bar-B-Q. Even more should be on the way once the $250 million Vybe District Park is completed.

Among other things, the settlement also requires the City to track response time details for requests for wheelchair-accessible vehicles compared to requests for non-wheelchair-accessible vehicles. The City must also advertise the improvements that are being made to the Uber Kyle $3.14 Program to increase accessibility on the City’s website and Twitter account. “In the Western District of Texas, people with disabilities must be able to count on accessible transportation service that is equal to the service provided to others,” said U.S. Attorney Hoff. “We commend the City’s collaborative approach to promoting equal access for Kyle residents with disabilities.” Assistant U.S. Attorneys Liane Noble and Thomas Parnham handled this matter for the United States.

San Antonio-based Rick Sheldon Real Estate LLC secured a slew of agreements from the Kyle City Council on Dec. 19 for the project in the fast-growing suburb south of downtown Austin. It's adjacent to the H-E-B grocery store near Farm to Market Road 1626 and Marketplace Ave. St. David's officials previously said they signed a letter of intent for a 65-acre tract, where the company plans to initially build a 160,000-square-foot, full-service acute care hospital. Details could shift once the land is purchased, but plans call for a 24-hour emergency department, inpatient and outpatient surgery, critical care capabilities, robotic services and maternity and newborn services. It's expected to create about 200 full-time jobs and was said to be a capital investment of $300 million. But that's only a part of what could eventually crop up on the site. Preliminary plans in development agreements passed by Council call for the site to be split into two tracts: The Lake Park tract, which would include vertical mixed-use components, including a 430-room hotel, roughly 300,000 square feet of retail space, 600,000 square feet of office space and 1,950 multifamily units both for sale or rent; and the hospital tract, which would eventually include a seven-floor hospital with 550 beds totaling 693,000 square feet and four medical offices totaling 80,000 square feet, plus a parking garage. As part of the agreement, the owners would donate parts of the site to be used for public space and infrastructure, including park space with natural waterways, a water tank and road extensions and widening. The agreement also has an option to turn the hospital site into more mixed-use space should the hospital not be constructed, although all indications are that it's on track. The site connects to the city's future Vybe Trail as well as other retail and housing options. Kyle Mayor Travis Mitchell said during the Dec. 19 meeting that the development checks all the boxes they are looking for in the fact that it has appropriate density, green space and a mixture of different uses. He commended the owner of the property for rejecting approximately 30 offers for just apartment or warehousing space and instead waiting to bring something he said rivals other mixed-use projects in the city like the Brick-and-Mortar District. \"It's going to be the neatest section of Vybe in the whole city, in my opinion,\" Mitchell said. Kyle is about 20 miles south of Austin and had an estimated 2022 population of about 57,500 — about 11% year-over-year growth that ranked it the third-fastest city in the country among those with a population of at least 50,000. That population growth has attracted a bunch of new employers and large-scale development, like more retail and mixed-use projects. Other notable companies that are opening in the space include Sovereign Flavors Inc. and Tesla Inc. Other retail projects include Costco Wholesale Corp., Sprouts Farmers Market and the $240 million Vybe Park. Originally announced in February 2022, St. David's detailed a plan to spend about $953 million on new facilities across the Austin metro and create at least 900 jobs. At the time, it was framed as the largest one-time capital investment for St. David's since its inception in 1996. St. David’s"

He commended the owner of the property for rejecting approximately 30 offers for just apartment or warehousing space and instead waiting to bring something he said rivals other mixed-use projects in the city like the Brick-and-Mortar District. \"It's going to be the neatest section of Vybe in the whole city, in my opinion,\" Mitchell said. Kyle is about 20 miles south of Austin and had an estimated 2022 population of about 57,500 — about 11% year-over-year growth that ranked it the third-fastest city in the country among those with a population of at least 50,000. That population growth has attracted a bunch of new employers and large-scale development, like more retail and mixed-use projects. Other notable companies that are opening in the space include Sovereign Flavors Inc. and Tesla Inc. Other retail projects include Costco Wholesale Corp., Sprouts Farmers Market and the $240 million Vybe Park. Originally announced in February 2022, St. David's detailed a plan to spend about $953 million on new facilities across the Austin metro and create at least 900 jobs. At the time, it was framed as the largest one-time capital investment for St. David's since its inception in 1996. St. David’s"

San Antonio-based Rick Sheldon Real Estate LLC secured a slew of agreements from the Kyle City Council on Dec. 19 for the project in the fast-growing suburb south of downtown Austin. It's adjacent to the H-E-B grocery store near Farm to Market Road 1626 and Marketplace Ave. St. David's officials previously said they signed a letter of intent for a 65-acre tract, where the company plans to initially build a 160,000-square-foot, full-service acute care hospital. Details could shift once the land is purchased, but plans call for a 24-hour emergency department, inpatient and outpatient surgery, critical care capabilities, robotic services and maternity and newborn services. It's expected to create about 200 full-time jobs and was said to be a capital investment of $300 million. But that's only a part of what could eventually crop up on the site. Preliminary plans in development agreements passed by Council call for the site to be split into two tracts: The Lake Park tract, which would include vertical mixed-use components, including a 430-room hotel, roughly 300,000 square feet of retail space, 600,000 square feet of office space and 1,950 multifamily units both for sale or rent; and the hospital tract, which would eventually include a seven-floor hospital with 550 beds totaling 693,000 square feet and four medical offices totaling 80,000 square feet, plus a parking garage. As part of the agreement, the owners would donate parts of the site to be used for public space and infrastructure, including park space with natural waterways, a water tank and road extensions and widening. The agreement also has an option to turn the hospital site into more mixed-use space should the hospital not be constructed, although all indications are that it's on track. The site connects to the city's future Vybe Trail as well as other retail and housing options.
