He believes in the difference teachers can make for students when they strive to make thinking visible, valued, and actively promoted as part of day-to-day experience of learners.

Mark Church Session: Rethinking Engagement Creating engaging opportunities for learning is at the core of promoting knowledge, skills, and understanding for learners of varying levels, backgrounds, and expertise. But what does it mean to create engaging opportunities that lead to deeper learning? For a number of years, the Cultures of Thinking project has worked closely with educators to examine the qualities and conditions it takes to engage learners by making their thinking visible, valued, and actively promoted. In my sessions, we will explore some big ideas related to deeper engagement, examine some quality practices that make learners’ thinking visible, and reflect upon our own teaching contexts in order to foster and sustain a rich culture of thinking.

Another Look at Making Thinking Visible Our LARAEC keynote speaker Mark Church came back for more! This session was designed to go a little bit more deeply into the exploration of thinking routines that promote depth of learning and engagement. When students, whatever their age, feel that their teachers have genuine interest in and curiosity for their thinking, they tend to bring their thinking more routinely to their learning. Participants who came to this additional online workshop had a chance to reflect upon their experiences to promote engagement and thinking more as inspired by ideas gleaned from the October event. And participants had the opportunity to learn a few more thinking routines that could be useful tools and structures to add to their practice.

Posted on February 15, 2023 (February 15, 2023) by Michele Stiehl In a survey of over 6,000 LARAEC students (spring 2022), 16% of our students reported that they met with a school counselor that year to discuss their goals and 14% said that they had received an education plan. A 2018 National Report from the Center for Community College Student Engagement, outlines the importance and value of student advising in helping students set and attain goals, feel part of the campus community, and stay the course. Quality advising programs can help with: Raising aspirations and setting goals – Helping students make a plan for the future and showing them pathways they might not have considered. Developing academic plans and registering for courses – Developing academic plans that work for student’s unique circumstances and helping them keep on track each semester. Helping students help themselves – Connecting students with needed services and opportunities that will help them be successful. Focusing on the big picture – Using information obtained from working with students to create school programs that help students persist and achieve outcomes. The report suggests that advising needs to be more intrusive, equitable and holistic. Advisors need to: Have in-depth conversations with students Be intentional about avoiding bias by addressing each student’s challenges Schools should consider if additional training and new processes need to be developed to allow for expanded advising. This report recognizes that it is challenging to find the time to conduct these types of meetings and that advisors often have large caseloads , but the benefits of holistic advising impact enrollment, persistence, completion, and transition rates . This report provides evidence of the connection between higher engagement and participation in advising . The full report offers examples of advising programs utilized in many community colleges. Although this study focuses on the community college population, there are many elements that can support counseling programs in adult education settings. Both venues serve a growing number of non-traditional students that need more support to be successful. Content condensed from: Center for Community College Student Engagement (2018).

Posted on February 15, 2023 (February 15, 2023) by Michele Stiehl In a survey of over 6,000 LARAEC students (spring 2022), 16% of our students reported that they met with a school counselor that year to discuss their goals and 14% said that they had received an education plan. A 2018 National Report from the Center for Community College Student Engagement, outlines the importance and value of student advising in helping students set and attain goals, feel part of the campus community, and stay the course. Quality advising programs can help with: Raising aspirations and setting goals – Helping students make a plan for the future and showing them pathways they might not have considered. Developing academic plans and registering for courses – Developing academic plans that work for student’s unique circumstances and helping them keep on track each semester. Helping students help themselves – Connecting students with needed services and opportunities that will help them be successful. Focusing on the big picture – Using information obtained from working with students to create school programs that help students persist and achieve outcomes. The report suggests that advising needs to be more intrusive, equitable and holistic. Advisors need to: Have in-depth conversations with students Be intentional about avoiding bias by addressing each student’s challenges Schools should consider if additional training and new processes need to be developed to allow for expanded advising. This report recognizes that it is challenging to find the time to conduct these types of meetings and that advisors often have large caseloads , but the benefits of holistic advising impact enrollment, persistence, completion, and transition rates . This report provides evidence of the connection between higher engagement and participation in advising . The full report offers examples of advising programs utilized in many community colleges. Although this study focuses on the community college population, there are many elements that can support counseling programs in adult education settings. Both venues serve a growing number of non-traditional students that need more support to be successful. Content condensed from: Center for Community College Student Engagement (2018).

This article was part of a larger journal series called Management Matters by Laura Freebairn-Smith, creator of the Organizational Development and Learning Center at Yale. This article has us consider some of the drawbacks of traditional decision-making practices , like consensus and voting. Sometimes decisions rely on a leader having the final say, sometimes fake consensus can lead to disengagement and skepticism, and sometimes consensus doesn’t value expert input.

We found an instructive article that the Council for Adult and Experiential learning (CAEL) published about how Trauma Impacts Adult Learners . This article contends that many of our students (and perhaps faculty and staff) have experienced or are currently experiencing trauma in their lives. Sometimes it is easy to see, sometimes students may talk about it, and sometimes it is invisible. The writer discusses how we all carry traumas with us like an omnipresent suitcase that is reopened every time it is triggered. This article offers suggestions for classrooms and schools to help ameliorate the effects of trauma on learning. One strategy for classrooms : Use the first 10 minutes of class to get everyone grounded and in a space for learning. A way to do this is have all students write down three words on their mind, then rewrite them using their non-dominant hand. This puts students in learning mode and resets the brain. One strategy for schools: Instead of providing support services in the main office and having students go to an unfamiliar and sometimes scary setting, bring the support services to students. Think of places that are non-threatening and engage students in a friendly accessible atmosphere. Have counselors engage regularly in classrooms, school community spaces, cafeterias, lobby, quads, learning centers, etc. Counselors or advisors can perhaps set up a table and tent on campus once a week with information. Staff can have online office hours with topics and publish these events in public spaces on campus. Give students questions to ask so they don’t feel nervous or threatened. The University of California, Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center published an article Five Ways to Support Students Affected by Trauma . The authors indicate that for many students school is a safe space. To help build an environment of growth and strength for students, the authors suggest we shift the conversation away from “what is wrong with the student?” toward “what does the student need to reach their potential?” In addition to counseling, the authors suggest five strategies that teachers can apply to their classrooms. Build positive relationships – Create a safe and trusting environment. Smile, share parts of your life, get to know your students personally, and be a role model of a reliable regulated adult. Create a positive physical space – put up positive quotes and affirmations, maximize natural light, arrange furniture to have students feel safe and connected, and bring plants. Utilize positive priming techniques – use brain breaks and other techniques to boost positive emotions in class. Use character strengths – help students learn about their own strengths and strengths of others. Build Resilience – Allow time for role playing, verbalizing feelings, and having empowering experiences at school. Both of these articles provide some easy and great ideas for supporting students!

Caylor Solutions created an ebook titled 25 Ideas for Great Admissions Content. Although this article is aimed at colleges and universities, there is so much to be gained for any organization. The strategies outlined move our thinking away from billboards, traditional advertisements, and direct marketing, toward creating discoverable content, building relationships, and providing potential students with soft landings on our school websites and campuses. This article covers 25 ideas for creating content that connects with people personally, compels them to share with others, or inspires action. Two of these ideas might be great places to start…. Discoverable Blog Posts and Articles: A great marketing strategy is to think of items that potential students might search for and then create an article of interest that provides both value and points to our programs. Examples might include: ESL- What is the value of taking an ESL class versus choosing an English app? How can I accelerate my language skills throughout my day? What should I look for in a quality ESL program? HSD/HSE – Strategies for being successful with online high school programs. How can I best prepare to take the HiSET or GED? CTE- What do I look for in a great ____program? What is the difference between CNA, LVN, and RN? What are some alternatives to college that lead to a good career? Process and Step-by-Step Checklists: We love checklists. Think of areas that potential students may have trouble navigating or seeing the big picture. What would they search for on the internet? Create a simple printable checklist or handout that provides an easy path. You can make this checklist discoverable in searches and bring people to your website to download the tool. It provides a service and a touchpoint. Examples might include: Things to do before, during, and after an interview College prep checklist or registration process How to get your cosmetologists license in California? What are the steps in becoming a US citizen? The full article has sooo many great ideas for creating interesting and actionable content.

What should I look for in a quality ESL program? HSD/HSE – Strategies for being successful with online high school programs. How can I best prepare to take the HiSET or GED?

Some of his recommendations: Don’t pay someone to create your content : take an inventory of the content assets you probably already have.

Posted on February 22, 2023 by Michele Stiehl ChatGPT is a form of artificial intelligence that can assist in teaching English to adult immigrants living in the United States by generating responses to prompts that simulate real life conversational situations. It can be used to generate idiomatic expressions, responses to common questions or complete dialogues. It can also be used to generate quizzes and exercises that test students’ understanding of grammar and vocabulary. However, it’s not without its limitations and controversy. When first introduced in November of 2022, it was decried by many teachers and experts as a tool for plagiarism because ChatGPT could produce work that plagiarism checkers like Turnitin might not detect. Furthermore, representatives of ChatGPT recommend that it be seen as complementary to learning with an experienced human teacher and other more traditional learning approaches. That said, Kristi Reyes and Ryan Detwiler, in their article, “ESL Meets AI: How We Can Make Our Lives Easier with ChatGPT” outline a number of benefits for ESL teachers employing this technology. They point out that it is simple and easy to use, but that it is not Google. It doesn’t just search an index of results. Instead, its answers are intelligently paraphrased, using concepts that it “understands” after identifying them in a query. Search questions can be tailored and refined for results that can be expressed in different tones and for a specific audience. Responses can also be written from a specific voice, perspective, or format. It can also be used to generate conversations within specific parameters. Reyes and Detwiler brainstormed multiple ways teachers might use ChatGPT to supplement and enhance work done in the classroom, including: Writing model dialogs with target vocabulary and grammar Comparing formal versus informal tones Generating conversation questions for class topics, vocabulary and grammar Punctuating and formatting text Scanning text and listing Academic Word List Vocabulary Generating multiple quizzes Rewriting texts for different levels Generating cloze and gap-fill activities Generating a list of vocabulary words and definitions from a text Asking students about their interests and needs and then creating individualized materials Generating sentences, paragraphs, and stories for vocabulary and grammar introduction Defining vocabulary and idioms with examples Answering complex grammar or vocabulary questions that a teacher may not be prepared to answer in the moment Writing scenarios for discussion and problem-based learning Writing lesson plans The article provides a nice introduction to ChatGPT with practical applications that ESL (and also basic skills) teachers can implement in the classroom easily. It also includes additional ideas that should have a direct impact on engagement and persistence in the classroom as well as a link to other AI tools and resources for further research.

Posted on February 22, 2023 by Michele Stiehl ChatGPT is a form of artificial intelligence that can assist in teaching English to adult immigrants living in the United States by generating responses to prompts that simulate real life conversational situations. It can be used to generate idiomatic expressions, responses to common questions or complete dialogues. It can also be used to generate quizzes and exercises that test students’ understanding of grammar and vocabulary. However, it’s not without its limitations and controversy. When first introduced in November of 2022, it was decried by many teachers and experts as a tool for plagiarism because ChatGPT could produce work that plagiarism checkers like Turnitin might not detect. Furthermore, representatives of ChatGPT recommend that it be seen as complementary to learning with an experienced human teacher and other more traditional learning approaches. That said, Kristi Reyes and Ryan Detwiler, in their article, “ESL Meets AI: How We Can Make Our Lives Easier with ChatGPT” outline a number of benefits for ESL teachers employing this technology. They point out that it is simple and easy to use, but that it is not Google. It doesn’t just search an index of results. Instead, its answers are intelligently paraphrased, using concepts that it “understands” after identifying them in a query. Search questions can be tailored and refined for results that can be expressed in different tones and for a specific audience. Responses can also be written from a specific voice, perspective, or format. It can also be used to generate conversations within specific parameters. Reyes and Detwiler brainstormed multiple ways teachers might use ChatGPT to supplement and enhance work done in the classroom, including: Writing model dialogs with target vocabulary and grammar Comparing formal versus informal tones Generating conversation questions for class topics, vocabulary and grammar Punctuating and formatting text Scanning text and listing Academic Word List Vocabulary Generating multiple quizzes Rewriting texts for different levels Generating cloze and gap-fill activities Generating a list of vocabulary words and definitions from a text Asking students about their interests and needs and then creating individualized materials Generating sentences, paragraphs, and stories for vocabulary and grammar introduction Defining vocabulary and idioms with examples Answering complex grammar or vocabulary questions that a teacher may not be prepared to answer in the moment Writing scenarios for discussion and problem-based learning Writing lesson plans The article provides a nice introduction to ChatGPT with practical applications that ESL (and also basic skills) teachers can implement in the classroom easily.

This study provided the first-hand experience of first-time community college students in the hopes of understanding why roughly 40% of college students drop out in the first year. Although this study focuses on college students, there are many conversations that may sound very familiar from our students and it may help your school begin to look at the your school’s experience from a student perspective. Some of the emerging conversations in the research were: The First Day – Student come in with nervousness, fear, excitement, concerns, hope. How do we welcome them? How do we connect them with others? How do we engage students, validate their state of being, and keep them coming back? How many students do we lose before they get started? Before Classes Begin – Are students prepared for learning? What registration processes do students have to get through? What orientation do we offer? Does the orientation set students up for success or just tell them information? Do our teachers reach out before classes start? Are students ready? Academic Plan – Are students clear about their goals and have a plan at your school? Do they have a timeline and an idea of where they are headed? Do they have a why and a path? Does your school ensure all students receive academic planning? Academic Support – What strategies does your school have in place when students need help academically? Is there a student success course that include study skills and time management? Ongoing, Intrusive Advising – Does your school have regular check-ins with students? What happens when a student gets off track? Is your counseling strategy hit-or-miss and focus on only on students who ask for help? Systems to Track Progress – Does your school have a system to track progress? What intervention happens when? This study provides a first-hand look at students’ experiences with many of these items. Additionally it includes conversations about high-impact teaching , motivation and confidence , widening the safety net and other questions for consideration.

Before Classes Begin – Are students prepared for learning? What registration processes do students have to get through? What orientation do we offer? Does the orientation set students up for success or just tell them information? Do our teachers reach out before classes start? Are students ready? Academic Plan – Are students clear about their goals and have a plan at your school? Do they have a timeline and an idea of where they are headed? Do they have a why and a path?

Maintaining Continuity of Instruction Los Angeles City College, LACCD The amazing Noncredit Adult Education team at Los Angeles City College saw the challenges of maintaining continuity of instruction during COVID 19 as an opportunity to create innovative and dynamic solutions to student, faculty, and college needs. Faculty banded together to share resources and create trainings that support student needs while Student Support personnel created opportunities for outreach, remote counselling, and enrollment services. Through the utilization of Canvas and Zoom, faculty worked together to identify skills that students would need to access course materials in this new environment and worked together to create how-to guides, lesson plans, faculty support opportunities, and a Welcome & Orientation module that scaffolds students through this experience. Likewise, Student Services personnel took advantage of communication technology such as Zoom, Cranium Café, and Google Voice to contact students, in multiple languages, in order to ensure learner access to campus support services, enrollment services, and direct class information. The result has been a consistently increasing number of students enrolling and participating in remotely instructed classes.

Topics in this story breast cancer chemotherapy Navy Veteran VA doctors VA Health Care VHA 75th Anniversary Women Veterans ﻿ ﻿ Navy Veteran Jacqueline learned she had breast cancer during a routine screening at the DC VA Medical Center. After getting all her cancer treatment at VA, she never wants to go back to the private sector for care. What did you know about VA? Did you have any preconceived notions about VA care? I had none. I went in blindfolded and just hoped for the best. And thankfully it has been a rewarding experience. I was laid off, out a job in 2012 due to outsourcing, which left me without insurance. I was approaching 40 years old and getting regular checkups was my main goal. When I started using the Washington DC VA Medical Center, they started having suspicion that I might have a tumor. Because I’ve gone through this over and over since my career in the military, and now as a Veteran, I really wasn’t alarmed. I just thought it might be something where the imaging is not showing up properly. We’ll do your regular testing and you’ll walk away and everything will be fine. Well, that was not the case. This time they did find something. And from that point on, and to this very day, I have been using the VA system as far as the chemotherapy, the radiation, the physical therapy. Who makes up your care team? Let me start off by saying my care team is the best in this world. And I owe them an enormous amount of gratitude. They have been from your women’s health. They have been from the oncology department, physical therapy. I even throw in voluntary services and my social workers. I guarantee you for my next physician, I have no intentions of using the private sector. My VA care is all in house and that to me is very, very important… for any Veteran. And it’s really sad that maybe some civilians don’t have that opportunity. Because you do really have to just go to whoever the specialist is and it could be from one side of town to the other. Not so with the VA Medical Center. Describe some of your visits there, what that world is like for you. To my surprise, it wound up being a very pleasant experience because no matter which service I would use, the staff and the physicians, they’re just happy to see you. You know they’re not happy for the situation, but they are happy to see you and the feeling was very mutual on my part. So you actually enjoyed your cancer treatment?

Billy j Wilson March 17, 2021 at 17:08 The few that get great care are very loud on the internet, but those not able to use the internet are hit with red tape and forms that are now where else to be found.

I had to go into the va and threaten them so she could get a referral to go private since the va is straight trash and wouldn’t let us go private. The va continues to s* on veterans everyday.

Over time I noticed that TriCare for retirees was getting worse and worse, the MTF’s had no room for us and would constantly farm you to the private sector. One day on a lark I decided to see if the VA was a better option for me and without a doubt it has been the best decision I could have ever made. The folks in Northeast Florida VA system are outstanding, my PCM team has gotten me to Optometry, Orthopedics, Audiology and Dermatology with absolutely no long waits or denials. I see my PCM Doc every 6 months without fail and I’m eternally great full for the VA system here in NE Florida for providing COVID 19 vaccines to any eligible VA patient no matter the age or condition, that alone has been worth the price of admission. Just remember the care may be free but it’s your earned benefit, don’t take no for an answer and keep the providers feet to the fire and they will respond.
