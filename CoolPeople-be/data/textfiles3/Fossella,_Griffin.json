The initiative originated as HUD’s Father’s Day in 2011, although it is well known that it’s the mothers that do much of the heavy lifting as it relates to raising families. In public housing communities where 75% of families are led by single women, that’s an enormous amount of responsibility, and one which should be given due consideration. HUD’s focus on Father’s Day was intended to bring awareness to the grim statistics children living in father-absent homes face. Fatherhood should not only be a topic with which we speak only with men. Fatherhood programs have more recently found that if they only work with men and never connect with their female partners, then there is less reason for the female partner to want to connect with the father. Our new focus on both parents will aim to connect men and women to resources that will aid in improving these outcomes and unify the family. Involved fathers empower mothers, and by empowering mothers, families succeed.

In addition to being unsafe, blighted properties decrease property values and erode the health of local housing markets. As a member of Griffin's \"Housing Improvement\" Task Force, GHA, City of Griffin, and Spalding County are actively assessing and identifying and where appropriate addressing blighted sub-standard properties throughout the city and the county. Empowered by our State Charter, and supported by national housing policies, GHA is working hard to rehab and/or demolish and rebuild areas of the city that have been defined as blighted and uninhabitable. Local residents who are living in blighted conditions are encouraged to contact us in efforts to determine an appropriate plan of action to improve their living conditions. 327 S. 9th Street | Griffin, GA 30224 Main Office: 770-227-7657 | Maintenance: 770-228-1808 | Emergency: 678-618-2058 West Point Emergency Maintenance: 706-585-1118 © 2019 | Griffin Housing Authority"
