That means more than 40,000 new mouths that New York taxpayers need to feed, and more than 40,000 new bodies that New York taxpayers have to shelter. For a city that’s already on the brink of a financial crisis, with a swelling homeless problem of its own to deal with, this is nothing short of a catastrophe in the making. It’s well past time that the federal government act to fix this problem. The Biden administration needs to step up, do its job, and stop the human flood that’s pouring in from Central and South America each and every day. And not just that, but the administration needs to foot part of the bill for causing this problem in the first place. They need to send our city much-needed federal reimbursement for the money that’s been spent – and will continue being spent – to provide for the busloads of people that have arrived in New York. Estimates are already saying that our migrant programs will cost us more than $2 billion –nearly the same amount as the annual budget for the entire FDNY. As a city, we’re having problems making sure we can cover the budget with the money we currently have – we simply cannot afford to take on the equivalent cost of an entirely new agency. We also need to reconsider our own designation as a sanctuary city as well. Our city’s homeless shelters are bursting at the seams, and adding more to the already overburdened shelter system is nothing short of irresponsible. It might be time for the mayor to think about getting rid of that “sanctuary city” designation, and face the reality that we simply can’t afford to virtue signal like this any longer. Now, let me be clear – I am not anti-immigration. My great grandparents (and one of my grandparents), like so many of your own ancestors, came across the ocean from Europe and set up a new life for themselves here in America. I’m all for passing on that kind of opportunity to the next wave of immigrants. What I am against, however, is the absolute waste of taxpayer dollars we’re seeing – taxpayer dollars spent to cater to people who have arrived here illegally in the first place. Thousands upon thousands of dollars wasted on food being thrown in the trash, Xboxes and big screen TV’s installed in migrant shelters, newcomers being put up in hotels right off of Times Square. The list goes on. We need to use some common sense with this stuff. We need to spend money correctly – and we shouldn’t be spending it frivolously on amenities for migrants when so many New Yorkers can otherwise benefit from that money. And if we do need to spend money to fix a mess made by the federal government, well then the federal government should have to pay for it. Do you have any issues you’d like to see addressed?

The list goes on. We need to use some common sense with this stuff. We need to spend money correctly – and we shouldn’t be spending it frivolously on amenities for migrants when so many New Yorkers can otherwise benefit from that money. And if we do need to spend money to fix a mess made by the federal government, well then the federal government should have to pay for it. Do you have any issues you’d like to see addressed?

They need to send our city much-needed federal reimbursement for the money that’s been spent – and will continue being spent – to provide for the busloads of people that have arrived in New York. Estimates are already saying that our migrant programs will cost us more than $2 billion –nearly the same amount as the annual budget for the entire FDNY.

This week, I’d like to take a minute to tell you all about some of the battles we’re waging in the Council and let you know of some of the developments going on behind the scenes. … READ MORE Rockaway Point News: Let’s Get Serious About Immigration January 20, 2023 In the past year alone, more than 40,000 migrants from the Southern border have made their way to the Big Apple. That means more than 40,000 new mouths that New York taxpayers need to feed, and more than 40,000 new bodies that New York taxpayers have to shelter. For a city that’s already on the brink of a financial crisis, with a swelling homeless problem of its own to deal with, this is nothing short of a catastrophe in the making. … READ MORE Rockaway Point News: Let’s Get Serious About Immigration January 20, 2023 In the past year alone, more than 40,000 migrants from the Southern border have made their way to the Big Apple.

She was born in Ozone Park and raised in Howard Beach. She attended P.S. 63 (Old South), P.S. 207 (Rockwood Park), Our Lady of Grace Catholic School, Stella Maris H.S. on the Rockaway Peninsula and Adelphi Business School. A longtime Queens civic leader, Ariola won a Republican Primary On June 22, 2021, with over 80 percent of the vote, and on November 2, 2021, she was elected to the NYC City Council in a General Election by a margin of over 65 percent. She subsequently entered into her second term after an unchallenged election in 2023. Since taking office, she has proven herself to be a common-sense moderate and serves as a member of the Republican Minority Caucus as well as the Common-Sense Caucus in the Council. Throughout her period in office, Councilwoman Ariola has put a strong focus on improving the quality of life in the neighborhoods of District 32. This means working closely with both city agencies and nonprofits to ensure that streets are cleaned, as well as advocating for more NYPD officers in our precincts. Councilwoman Ariola was also a sponsor of Int. 1001, which holds landlords accountable for knowingly renting properties to individuals selling unlicensed marijuana products. The Councilwoman has also fiercely advocated for medical freedom, rallying repeatedly for city workers who were wrongfully removed from their jobs for COVID-19 vaccine non-compliance. To that end, the Councilwoman introduced Reso 5 in early 2024, which calls upon the City of New York to immediately bring any and all city workers back to the workforce should they still desire their positions. A large portion of the 32nd Council District is geographically centered around Jamaica Bay, and as such the Councilwoman has also made cleaning up our waterways a priority. One of her proudest achievements to date was her creation of the Office of Marine Debris and Removal – an entirely new mayoral office that would be directly responsible for cleaning our waterways and disposing of derelict and unwanted vessels.

A large portion of the 32nd Council District is geographically centered around Jamaica Bay, and as such the Councilwoman has also made cleaning up our waterways a priority. One of her proudest achievements to date was her creation of the Office of Marine Debris and Removal – an entirely new mayoral office that would be directly responsible for cleaning our waterways and disposing of derelict and unwanted vessels. Biography Joann Ariola is a lifelong resident of the 32nd Council District. She was born in Ozone Park and raised in Howard Beach. She attended P.S. 63 (Old South), P.S. 207 (Rockwood Park), Our Lady of Grace Catholic School, Stella Maris H.S. on the Rockaway Peninsula and Adelphi Business School. A longtime Queens civic leader, Ariola won a Republican Primary On June 22, 2021, with over 80 percent of the vote, and on November 2, 2021, she was elected to the NYC City Council in a General Election by a margin of over 65 percent. She subsequently entered into her second term after an unchallenged election in 2023. Since taking office, she has proven herself to be a common-sense moderate and serves as a member of the Republican Minority Caucus as well as the Common-Sense Caucus in the Council. Throughout her period in office, Councilwoman Ariola has put a strong focus on improving the quality of life in the neighborhoods of District 32. This means working closely with both city agencies and nonprofits to ensure that streets are cleaned, as well as advocating for more NYPD officers in our precincts. Councilwoman Ariola was also a sponsor of Int. 1001, which holds landlords accountable for knowingly renting properties to individuals selling unlicensed marijuana products.

Republican Joann Ariola collected 53 of the tribute flags from generous New Yorkers since beginning an online campaign two weeks ago. The councilwoman already delivered blue-line flags to five Queens police precincts and red-line flags to four Queens firehouses, she told The Post. NYC Councilwoman Joann Ariola is making it her mission to provide all NYPD precincts and FDNY firehouses with thin “red-line” and “blue-line” American flags honoring hero first responders. – Helayne Seidman “Far left activists are trying to turn the public against our first responders and sow chaos in this city,” said Ariola. “This campaign is a show of support for our first responders, to let them know that no matter what, the people of this city stand behind them.” Ariola began her effort two weeks ago, in response to a Post report about an FDNY deputy chief ordering an East Village ladder company to remove a “red line” American flag honoring the squad’s six members killed on 9/11. The request came after a neighborhood resident called the flag “fascist,” and Councilwoman Carlina Rivera (D-Manhattan) questioned whether it was a “politically charged symbol.” The department was following a 2020 FDNY rule prohibiting “altered” versions of the American flag on department property, which was implemented under then-Commissioner Daniel Nigro during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests. News of the flag removal March 22 sparked immediate outrage on social media, and hours later the FDNY reversed the decision. Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh confirmed to The Post she “unequivocally support[s]” firefighters displaying the tribute flags. “The redline flag honors firefighters who lost their lives protecting our city,” she said. “We appreciate Councilwoman Ariola’s efforts in offering this flag to firehouses who will fly it proudly.” The Police Department doesn’t have rules prohibiting blue-line flags on NYPD property. Commanding officers at the 100 th , 102 nd , 104 th , 106 th and 112 th precincts in Queens have accepted blue-line flags honoring cops killed or injured in the line of duty, according to Ariola, who plans to expand the giveaway citywide. Rivera previously insisted to The Post she only reached to the FDNY about Ladder Co. 11’s tribute flag because a constituent complained about it and that she has a “strong” relationship with the firehouse. However, Rivera has a history of being critical of cops, including voting to defund the NYPD by $1 billion in 2020 and routinely ripping police officers that same year during the Black Lives Matters protests. Rivera did not return messages.

During the speech, the Speaker outlined her agenda to recreate New York City in a way that would put “people over everything” and improve the lives of New Yorkers. I must say that although I was encouraged by a number of the Speaker’s proposed initiatives–I do think the proposals regarding public safety and some of the usage of taxpayer dollars are completely off the mark. First and foremost, I think the stated goal to close Rikers Island is a mistake. Riker’s Island has its problems, sure, but the solution is not to shut the place down and disperse criminals into far smaller “borough-based jails.” Instead, we should be better funding Rikers Island so that it can become a world-class justice center that can serve as a model to others across the country. Invest in the mental health services available to those incarcerated there, invest in hiring more Correction Officers so staffers aren’t overworked and overstressed, and invest in state-of-the-art drug rehabilitation services. Don’t shut the whole thing down and think that somehow dispersing people into smaller facilities with fewer available resources will solve the problem. And certainly, don’t make it so there are fewer beds available to house those awaiting trial. Under the borough-based jails plan, there would be approximately 3,300 beds available for incarcerated individuals throughout the city. According to the Manhattan Institute, “that figure is 40% lower than the average population recorded at Rikers throughout 2022 (roughly 5,500 through mid-September). It is lower than the lowest daily population (3,809) recorded during the Covid-19 pandemic, when jail decarceration was a nationwide priority. It is smaller, in fact than almost any figure recorded since the Rikers jail complex opened.” We as a city are already seeing the effects of a revolving door justice system, with criminals being put back on the street hours after being arrested for an offense. What do you think will happen when we have 40% fewer beds to hold offenders in the future? Next, let’s talk about the proposal to pour city funding into “mobile healthcare” hubs for delivery workers. If we really want to help New York City’s delivery workers, let’s make sure that the vehicles they’re operating aren’t going to explode from under them, rather than dumping taxpayer money into hubs specifically set aside for one segment of the workforce to utilize. Let’s make sure that more legislation is passed so that only properly certified lithium-ion batteries are available to delivery workers so that their bikes and scooters don’t keep setting fire to apartment buildings and homes across the city. Furthermore, the onus of providing these qualified batteries to delivery workers should fall on the major corporations like GrubHub and UberEats, not on New York’s taxpayers. Providing delivery people with safe, reliable batteries can dramatically improve their quality of life without causing a major dent in the city’s coffers. We have a spiraling mental health crisis to deal with. Our veterans aren’t getting the services many desperately need. Crime is growing by the day. How does the city think that spending massive amounts of funding to cater to one specific group of workers with “mobile healthcare” is going to be the solution to these issues? And, if the city is really serious about opening “mobile healthcare hubs,” why not make them available to veterans and others in need as well? It’s time that New Yorkers across the five boroughs take a stand for common sense. In 2021, we expanded the number of Common Sense Legislators in the City Council, and last year we saw one Democratic Councilman switch his party affiliation after recognizing the disastrous policies the progressive far left was pursuing in city government. On top of that, 15 members of the Progressive Caucus resigned from the Caucus because they were mandated to sign a pledge to defund the police, close Rikers, and remove Correction Officers. That exodus ended the super majority the progressives once held. Within just two years,"

Invest in the mental health services available to those incarcerated there, invest in hiring more Correction Officers so staffers aren’t overworked and overstressed, and invest in state-of-the-art drug rehabilitation services. Don’t shut the whole thing down and think that somehow dispersing people into smaller facilities with fewer available resources will solve the problem. And certainly, don’t make it so there are fewer beds available to house those awaiting trial. Under the borough-based jails plan, there would be approximately 3,300 beds available for incarcerated individuals throughout the city. According to the Manhattan Institute, “that figure is 40% lower than the average population recorded at Rikers throughout 2022 (roughly 5,500 through mid-September). It is lower than the lowest daily population (3,809) recorded during the Covid-19 pandemic, when jail decarceration was a nationwide priority. It is smaller, in fact than almost any figure recorded since the Rikers jail complex opened.” We as a city are already seeing the effects of a revolving door justice system, with criminals being put back on the street hours after being arrested for an offense. What do you think will happen when we have 40% fewer beds to hold offenders in the future? Next, let’s talk about the proposal to pour city funding into “mobile healthcare” hubs for delivery workers. If we really want to help New York City’s delivery workers, let’s make sure that the vehicles they’re operating aren’t going to explode from under them, rather than dumping taxpayer money into hubs specifically set aside for one segment of the workforce to utilize. Let’s make sure that more legislation is passed so that only properly certified lithium-ion batteries are available to delivery workers so that their bikes and scooters don’t keep setting fire to apartment buildings and homes across the city. Furthermore, the onus of providing these qualified batteries to delivery workers should fall on the major corporations like GrubHub and UberEats, not on New York’s taxpayers. Providing delivery people with safe, reliable batteries can dramatically improve their quality of life without causing a major dent in the city’s coffers. We have a spiraling mental health crisis to deal with. Our veterans aren’t getting the services many desperately need. Crime is growing by the day. How does the city think that spending massive amounts of funding to cater to one specific group of workers with “mobile healthcare” is going to be the solution to these issues? And, if the city is really serious about opening “mobile healthcare hubs,” why not make them available to veterans and others in need as well? It’s time that New Yorkers across the five boroughs take a stand for common sense. In 2021, we expanded the number of Common Sense Legislators in the City Council, and last year we saw one Democratic Councilman switch his party affiliation after recognizing the disastrous policies the progressive far left was pursuing in city government. On top of that, 15 members of the Progressive Caucus resigned from the Caucus because they were mandated to sign a pledge to defund the police, close Rikers, and remove Correction Officers. That exodus ended the super majority the progressives once held. Within just two years, we’ve been able to advance our numbers in"

The councilwoman steered millions of dollars to help maintain vital services and organizations this year in her expansive district, which includes Breezy Point , Broad Channel , Glendale , Howard Beach , Ozone Park and Woodhaven . Ariola, while acknowledging her Republican minority status, attributes her budgetary success to engaging with the community and maintaining ongoing proactive relationships with city entities. “Those relationships really are based on accountability. It’s my job to have the relationship but also hold them accountable,” Ariola told QNS. “And they understand that they know that I’m not asking anything for myself; I’m asking for my constituents.” Ariola’s budgetary triumph includes millions for enhancing older adult programs, schools, public safety efforts and local volunteer organizations. For instance, three Glendale schools are getting a combined $500,000 from the funding round for advanced media rooms, better technology and structural upgrades like new water fountains and bathrooms. The redistricting of city council lines across Queens last year allowed Ariola to take the lead as the legislative representative for the neighborhood. “I focused a lot in Glendale and Woodhaven because those were my pickup areas,” Ariola explained, emphasizing the importance of adequate legislative leadership in Queens. An effort to visit schools in the district also played a key role in deciding where the taxpayer money was spent. “I went there and learned a lot,” Ariola said. “We’re all about getting to know the people and having a relationship, because if you don’t have a relationship with your schools, you don’t have a relationship with your civics.” One educational program that gained special attention from the Queens council member is Inside Broadway , a non-profit organization that provides schools with a performance arts education curriculum for a wide range of age groups from K to 12th grade. Ariola shared that the $80,000 allotted to the Inside Broadway program will allow schools to embed performing arts into their curriculum. Funding was also allocated for services for older adults, including senior centers and programs aimed at helping seniors adapt to modern life. Ariola secured a total of $110,000 for aging services, with over $5,000 designated for senior centers in Howard Beach, Woodhaven, Richmond Hill, Ozone Park and other areas in her district. Graffiti removal and street clean-up initiatives in the district have been awarded nearly $280,000. The funds are distributed to nonprofit organizations that have already been actively working to remove graffiti and litter in Ariola’s district, including the Queens Economic Development Corporation and the Center for Employment Opportunities . Law enforcement remained a top priority for Ariola, with community safety and domestic violence programs from the 100th , 102nd , 104th and 106th NYPD precincts each receiving $25,000 from the budget. Volunteer-based organizations, including local pet rescues, are also marked to receive $5,000 each to help their causes. Ariola has prioritized helping pet rescue organizations in her district with donation events. A $6 million project to build a skate park in Broad Channel has been funded, according to information from the councilwoman’s office. Ariola noted that deciding how city council funds are allocated can often be challenging. She said the process of determining where the funds go often comes from looking at the past and analyzing how each recipient spent their funding. “It’s important to me to make sure that the constituents realize that as their representative in the city council, it’s my job to make sure that their money is being spent wisely,” Ariola said, recognizing that taxpayer dollars are the backbone of city council funds. At the end of June, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams agreed on a $112.4 billion budget for fiscal year 2025, amid growing tensions between the governing bodies. The agreed budget restored vital services, including funding for New York City Public Libraries and the Department of Education,"

    "text": "New York City Council Search for: Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 32 Joann Ariola Glendale, Forest Park, Ozone Park (North), Woodhaven, Ozone Park, Howard Beach-Lindenwood, Spring Creek Park, Broad Channel, Rockaway Beach, Rockaway Park, Belle Harbor, Neponsit, Roxbury, Jacob Riis Park, Fort Tilden, Breezy Point QNS – Council Member Joann Ariola secures $31 Million for Queens District 32 in NYC budge July 23, 2024 By Anthony Medina Queens City Council Member Joann Ariola , representing City Council District 32 residents, has secured $31 million in funding as part of the recently approved New York City Council budget for fiscal year 2025. The councilwoman steered millions of dollars to help maintain vital services and organizations this year in her expansive district, which includes Breezy Point , Broad Channel , Glendale , Howard Beach , Ozone Park and Woodhaven . Ariola, while acknowledging her Republican minority status, attributes her budgetary success to engaging with the community and maintaining ongoing proactive relationships with city entities. “Those relationships really are based on accountability. It’s my job to have the relationship but also hold them accountable,” Ariola told QNS. “And they understand that they know that I’m not asking anything for myself; I’m asking for my constituents.” Ariola’s budgetary triumph includes millions for enhancing older adult programs, schools, public safety efforts and local volunteer organizations. For instance, three Glendale schools are getting a combined $500,000 from the funding round for advanced media rooms, better technology and structural upgrades like new water fountains and bathrooms. The redistricting of city council lines across Queens last year allowed Ariola to take the lead as the legislative representative for the neighborhood. “I focused a lot in Glendale and Woodhaven because those were my pickup areas,” Ariola explained, emphasizing the importance of adequate legislative leadership in Queens. An effort to visit schools in the district also played a key role in deciding where the taxpayer money was spent. “I went there and learned a lot,” Ariola said. “We’re all about getting to know the people and having a relationship, because if you don’t have a relationship with your schools, you don’t have a relationship with your civics.” One educational program that gained special attention from the Queens council member is Inside Broadway , a non-profit organization that provides schools with a performance arts education curriculum for a wide range of age groups from K to 12th grade. Ariola shared that the $80,000 allotted to the Inside Broadway program will allow schools to embed performing arts into their curriculum. Funding was also allocated for services for older adults, including senior centers and programs aimed at helping seniors adapt to modern life. Ariola secured a total of $110,000 for aging services, with over $5,000 designated for senior centers in Howard Beach, Woodhaven, Richmond Hill, Ozone Park and other areas in her district. Graffiti removal and street clean-up initiatives in the district have been awarded nearly $280,000. The funds are distributed to nonprofit organizations that have already been actively working to remove graffiti and litter in Ariola’s district, including the Queens Economic Development Corporation and the Center for Employment Opportunities . Law enforcement remained a top priority for Ariola, with community safety and domestic violence programs from the 100th , 102nd , 104th and 106th NYPD precincts each receiving $25,000 from the budget. Volunteer-based organizations, including local pet rescues, are also marked to receive $5,000 each to help their causes. Ariola has prioritized helping pet rescue organizations in her district with donation events. A $6 million project to build a skate park in Broad Channel has been funded, according to information from the councilwoman’s office. Ariola noted that deciding how city council funds are allocated can often be challenging. She said the process of determining where the funds go often comes from looking at the past and analyzing how each recipient spent their funding. “It’s important to me to make sure that the constituents realize that as their representative in the city council, it’s my job to make sure that their money is being spent wisely,” Ariola said, recognizing that taxpayer dollars are the backbone of city council funds. At the end of June, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams agreed on a $112.4 billion budget for fiscal year 2025, amid growing tensions between the governing bodies. The agreed budget restored vital services, including funding for New York City Public Libraries and the Department of Education,"

Link to story: https://qns.com/2024/07/council-member-joann-ariola-secures-31-million-queens-district-32-nyc-budget/ Posted in Uncategorized QNS – Council Member Joann Ariola secures $31 Million for Queens District 32 in NYC budge July 23, 2024 By Anthony Medina Queens City Council Member Joann Ariola , representing City Council District 32 residents, has secured $31 million in funding as part of the recently approved New York City Council budget for fiscal year 2025. The councilwoman steered millions of dollars to help maintain vital services and organizations this year in her expansive district, which includes Breezy Point , Broad Channel , Glendale , Howard Beach , Ozone Park and Woodhaven . Ariola, while acknowledging her Republican minority status, attributes her budgetary success to engaging with the community and maintaining ongoing proactive relationships with city entities. “Those relationships really are based on accountability. It’s my job to have the relationship but also hold them accountable,” Ariola told QNS. “And they understand that they know that I’m not asking anything for myself; I’m asking for my constituents.” Ariola’s budgetary triumph includes millions for enhancing older adult programs, schools, public safety efforts and local volunteer organizations. For instance, three Glendale schools are getting a combined $500,000 from the funding round for advanced media rooms, better technology and structural upgrades like new water fountains and bathrooms. The redistricting of city council lines across Queens last year allowed Ariola to take the lead as the legislative representative for the neighborhood. “I focused a lot in Glendale and Woodhaven because those were my pickup areas,” Ariola explained, emphasizing the importance of adequate legislative leadership in Queens. An effort to visit schools in the district also played a key role in deciding where the taxpayer money was spent. “I went there and learned a lot,” Ariola said. “We’re all about getting to know the people and having a relationship, because if you don’t have a relationship with your schools, you don’t have a relationship with your civics.” One educational program that gained special attention from the Queens council member is Inside Broadway , a non-profit organization that provides schools with a performance arts education curriculum for a wide range of age groups from K to 12th grade. Ariola shared that the $80,000 allotted to the Inside Broadway program will allow schools to embed performing arts into their curriculum. Funding was also allocated for services for older adults, including senior centers and programs aimed at helping seniors adapt to modern life. Ariola secured a total of $110,000 for aging services, with over $5,000 designated for senior centers in Howard Beach, Woodhaven, Richmond Hill, Ozone Park and other areas in her district. Graffiti removal and street clean-up initiatives in the district have been awarded nearly $280,000. The funds are distributed to nonprofit organizations that have already been actively working to remove graffiti and litter in Ariola’s district, including the Queens Economic Development Corporation and the Center for Employment Opportunities . Law enforcement remained a top priority for Ariola, with community safety and domestic violence programs from the 100th , 102nd , 104th and 106th NYPD precincts each receiving $25,000 from the budget. Volunteer-based organizations, including local pet rescues, are also marked to receive $5,000 each to help their causes. Ariola has prioritized helping pet rescue organizations in her district with donation events. A $6 million project to build a skate park in Broad Channel has been funded, according to information from the councilwoman’s office. Ariola noted that deciding how city council funds are allocated can often be challenging. She said the process of determining where the funds go often comes from looking at the past and analyzing how each recipient spent their funding. “It’s important to me to make sure that the constituents realize that as their representative in the city council, it’s my job to make sure that their money is being spent wisely,” Ariola said, recognizing that taxpayer dollars are the backbone of city council funds.

November 30, 2023 By NYC Councilwoman Joann Ariola & Col. Thomas P. Sullivan, Candidate for NYS Assembly New York City is in a tailspin. In large part thanks to the growing – and completely mishandled – migrant crisis, Mayor Eric Adams has announced that he’s planning enormous slashes to city services across the board. $32 million in cuts to the DSNY. $74 million from the FDNY. $132 million from the NYPD. A staggering $547 million from the Department of Education. The ensuing quality of life fallout from this will no doubt be disastrous. These are exactly the last departments that should be cut, as they represent the essential services that we expect from our taxes. This is when we need to ask ourselves: where is Governor Hochul? Why is no one in Albany holding the governor accountable for ignoring federal immigration laws, and forcing her to pay for the migrant crisis that she herself is helping to perpetuate? When NYC signed the disastrous lease deal for Floyd Bennett Field, for example, the governor was supposed to cover that $22 million rental bill. Since then, we’ve gotten pennies from Albany. That $22 million dollars could be used to help ensure that DSNY litter-basket pickup service remains uninterrupted, something which Mayor Adams has already said will be cut back significantly. It could pay to maintain the DSNY’s lot cleaning unit, which many say will be completely disbanded thanks to the city’s drawdown. It could help to pay for a new police class to keep the NYPD at a functional manpower level, and it could support overtime pay for the FDNY so that our firehouses remain fully staffed. It could be used to pay for safety agents in our schools instead of falling back onto the Mayor’s call for parents to volunteer time as school security – something especially needed now, as anti-Semitic riots are escalating and threatening both students and teachers across the city. And that $22 million is just a small drop in the bucket when we look at the big picture. The migrant crisis is estimated to cost New York City’s taxpayers as much as $12 billion over the next two years, and the state is doing next to nothing to offset this. If Albany wants to keep saying that New York is a sanctuary state, and if Governor Hochul wants to keep welcoming migrants in with open arms, then Albany and Governor Hochul should help to pay for it. With a completely complicit Democratic supermajority in the Assembly and Senate, however, this seems unlikely to ever happen. If we want to hold Governor Hochul accountable, we need a state legislature that will actually stand up to her. Currently, the majority of New York’s state senate and assembly, including our own locally-elected members, are all too comfortable going along with Hochul’s migrants-first policy. And, since our local state leaders won’t stand up for our communities, Governor Hochul is allowed to get away with this double whammy, forcing us to take thousands of migrants while also forcing New York City’s taxpayers to pay for it. This is simply unsustainable, and the effects of these short-sighted policies built on little more than idealism without any check of reality are now starting to be felt. Unless something changes, we are going to continue our descent into political and financial chaos. We need competent State leaders who will defend the rights and security of citizens in our districts. Our communities deserve representatives who will put them first, and who will hold Albany accountable to ensure that essential services like police, fire, education, and sanitation receive optimal funding. It is time for a change. Elected officials who do not stand up for their communities are not worthy of our support. We must send a clear message to Albany and City Hall that this crisis must be resolved, and our essential services must be restored. Think about that when you head into the voting booth next year.

November 30, 2023 By NYC Councilwoman Joann Ariola & Col. Thomas P. Sullivan, Candidate for NYS Assembly New York City is in a tailspin. In large part thanks to the growing – and completely mishandled – migrant crisis, Mayor Eric Adams has announced that he’s planning enormous slashes to city services across the board. $32 million in cuts to the DSNY. $74 million from the FDNY. $132 million from the NYPD. A staggering $547 million from the Department of Education. The ensuing quality of life fallout from this will no doubt be disastrous. These are exactly the last departments that should be cut, as they represent the essential services that we expect from our taxes. This is when we need to ask ourselves: where is Governor Hochul? Why is no one in Albany holding the governor accountable for ignoring federal immigration laws, and forcing her to pay for the migrant crisis that she herself is helping to perpetuate? When NYC signed the disastrous lease deal for Floyd Bennett Field, for example, the governor was supposed to cover that $22 million rental bill. Since then, we’ve gotten pennies from Albany. That $22 million dollars could be used to help ensure that DSNY litter-basket pickup service remains uninterrupted, something which Mayor Adams has already said will be cut back significantly. It could pay to maintain the DSNY’s lot cleaning unit, which many say will be completely disbanded thanks to the city’s drawdown. It could help to pay for a new police class to keep the NYPD at a functional manpower level, and it could support overtime pay for the FDNY so that our firehouses remain fully staffed. It could be used to pay for safety agents in our schools instead of falling back onto the Mayor’s call for parents to volunteer time as school security – something especially needed now, as anti-Semitic riots are escalating and threatening both students and teachers across the city. And that $22 million is just a small drop in the bucket when we look at the big picture. The migrant crisis is estimated to cost New York City’s taxpayers as much as $12 billion over the next two years, and the state is doing next to nothing to offset this. If Albany wants to keep saying that New York is a sanctuary state, and if Governor Hochul wants to keep welcoming migrants in with open arms, then Albany and Governor Hochul should help to pay for it. With a completely complicit Democratic supermajority in the Assembly and Senate, however, this seems unlikely to ever happen. If we want to hold Governor Hochul accountable, we need a state legislature that will actually stand up to her. Currently, the majority of New York’s state senate and assembly, including our own locally-elected members, are all too comfortable going along with Hochul’s migrants-first policy. And, since our local state leaders won’t stand up for our communities, Governor Hochul is allowed to get away with this double whammy, forcing us to take thousands of migrants while also forcing New York City’s taxpayers to pay for it. This is simply unsustainable, and the effects of these short-sighted policies built on little more than idealism without any check of reality are now starting to be felt. Unless something changes, we are going to continue our descent into political and financial chaos. We need competent State leaders who will defend the rights and security of citizens in our districts. Our communities deserve representatives who will put them first, and who will hold Albany accountable to ensure that essential services like police, fire, education, and sanitation receive optimal funding. It is time for a change. Elected officials who do not stand up for their communities are not worthy of our support. We must send a clear message to Albany and City Hall that this crisis must be resolved, and our essential services must be restored. Think about that when you head into the voting booth next year.

Why is no one in Albany holding the governor accountable for ignoring federal immigration laws, and forcing her to pay for the migrant crisis that she herself is helping to perpetuate? When NYC signed the disastrous lease deal for Floyd Bennett Field, for example, the governor was supposed to cover that $22 million rental bill. Since then, we’ve gotten pennies from Albany. That $22 million dollars could be used to help ensure that DSNY litter-basket pickup service remains uninterrupted, something which Mayor Adams has already said will be cut back significantly. It could pay to maintain the DSNY’s lot cleaning unit, which many say will be completely disbanded thanks to the city’s drawdown. It could help to pay for a new police class to keep the NYPD at a functional manpower level, and it could support overtime pay for the FDNY so that our firehouses remain fully staffed. It could be used to pay for safety agents in our schools instead of falling back onto the Mayor’s call for parents to volunteer time as school security – something especially needed now, as anti-Semitic riots are escalating and threatening both students and teachers across the city. And that $22 million is just a small drop in the bucket when we look at the big picture. The migrant crisis is estimated to cost New York City’s taxpayers as much as $12 billion over the next two years, and the state is doing next to nothing to offset this. If Albany wants to keep saying that New York is a sanctuary state, and if Governor Hochul wants to keep welcoming migrants in with open arms, then Albany and Governor Hochul should help to pay for it. With a completely complicit Democratic supermajority in the Assembly and Senate, however, this seems unlikely to ever happen. If we want to hold Governor Hochul accountable, we need a state legislature that will actually stand up to her. Currently, the majority of New York’s state senate and assembly, including our own locally-elected members, are all too comfortable going along with Hochul’s migrants-first policy. And, since our local state leaders won’t stand up for our communities, Governor Hochul is allowed to get away with this double whammy, forcing us to take thousands of migrants while also forcing New York City’s taxpayers to pay for it. This is simply unsustainable, and the effects of these short-sighted policies built on little more than idealism without any check of reality are now starting to be felt. Unless something changes, we are going to continue our descent into political and financial chaos. We need competent State leaders who will defend the rights and security of citizens in our districts. Our communities deserve representatives who will put them first, and who will hold Albany accountable to ensure that essential services like police, fire, education, and sanitation receive optimal funding. It is time for a change. Elected officials who do not stand up for their communities are not worthy of our support. We must send a clear message to Albany and City Hall that this crisis must be resolved, and our essential services must be restored. Think about that when you head into the voting booth next year.

Especially in light of the tragedy last weekend and the near assassination of former President Trump, all eyes are very firmly glued to the race for the White House. Amidst all of this, however, we should remind ourselves of the old adage “all politics is local,” and keep a sharp focus on the elections of our state and Congressional lawmakers as well. I urge everyone reading this to take some time and really get to know those who are on November’s ballot for the NYS Assembly, NYS Senate, and Congress in your neighborhood. Ask yourselves “How has this person voted/how will this person vote,” and ask how those votes have impacted, or would impact, you and your family. Do these people really have your interests and the interests of your community at heart, or are they just there to fill a seat? If you go to local civic meetings, take note of which politicians attend, which ones have representatives there to listen, and which ones skip them altogether. Consider their positions on crucial issues like bail reform or the migrant crisis, and ask who has actually shown up to fight against these things, and who only paid lip service to those fights. Elections have tremendous consequences, and the current state of our city is proof of that. Our services are swamped because of the billions we are spending to support a flood of asylum seekers living on the city’s dime, and our law enforcement officers continually find themselves handcuffed and unable to do their jobs because of bungled legislation from Albany. These issues are the direct result of elections and were brought about because New Yorkers did not vote for those who have YOUR interests at heart. That’s why it is so very important that you personally do your homework before Election Day, and really read up on the candidates being presented to you. Make sure that their values actually align with your values, and don’t simply vote because you read a few tweets about someone and then made up your mind. Look beyond the tweets and the headlines. Look at voting records. Look at their community involvement. Ask yourself if this person would actually fight for you in Albany or in D.C., or if they are just there to pick up a check. Thomas Jefferson once said, “Whenever the people are well informed, they can be trusted with their own government.” Those words are just as true today as they were when he first wrote them back in 1789. So, I ask all of you to continue the legacy left to us by men like Jefferson, and please stay well informed this election. Do some deep dives into the candidates before you. Check and double-check your sources when you see anything posted online. Form your decisions about the candidates based on who will be best for you, your family, and your community. Become well-informed, and vote for a better future this November.

Especially in light of the tragedy last weekend and the near assassination of former President Trump, all eyes are very firmly glued to the race for the White House. Amidst all of this, however, we should remind ourselves of the old adage “all politics is local,” and keep a sharp focus on the elections of our state and Congressional lawmakers as well.

Ask yourselves “How has this person voted/how will this person vote,” and ask how those votes have impacted, or would impact, you and your family. Do these people really have your interests and the interests of your community at heart, or are they just there to fill a seat? If you go to local civic meetings, take note of which politicians attend, which ones have representatives there to listen, and which ones skip them altogether. Consider their positions on crucial issues like bail reform or the migrant crisis, and ask who has actually shown up to fight against these things, and who only paid lip service to those fights. Elections have tremendous consequences, and the current state of our city is proof of that. Our services are swamped because of the billions we are spending to support a flood of asylum seekers living on the city’s dime, and our law enforcement officers continually find themselves handcuffed and unable to do their jobs because of bungled legislation from Albany. These issues are the direct result of elections and were brought about because New Yorkers did not vote for those who have YOUR interests at heart. That’s why it is so very important that you personally do your homework before Election Day, and really read up on the candidates being presented to you. Make sure that their values actually align with your values, and don’t simply vote because you read a few tweets about someone and then made up your mind. Look beyond the tweets and the headlines. Look at voting records. Look at their community involvement. Ask yourself if this person would actually fight for you in Albany or in D.C., or if they are just there to pick up a check. Thomas Jefferson once said, “Whenever the people are well informed, they can be trusted with their own government.” Those words are just as true today as they were when he first wrote them back in 1789. So, I ask all of you to continue the legacy left to us by men like Jefferson, and please stay well informed this election. Do some deep dives into the candidates before you. Check and double-check your sources when you see anything posted online. Form your decisions about the candidates based on who will be best for you, your family, and your community.

Every week participants of the Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO)— a second-chance program giving formerly incarcerated people support in finding jobs — work to keep the Queens neighborhoods in Ariola’s district (D-23) clear of trash and dangerous conditions. Ariola allocated $79,000 in discretionary funding to the CEO organization this year and plans to utilize the program moving forward. The council member says this collaboration between CEO and her office benefits everyone involved—from the community to the previously incarcerated, who are trying to integrate themselves back into society. “Not only does it help our residents, but it also helps the workers at CEO as well,” Ariola said. “They give people a second chance and help integrate their employees back into society by giving them jobs and putting them on the road to success.” The group, aided by Ariola’s office, has cleaned up several locations where trash has accumulated, including Colman Square and Shore Parkway in Howard Beach; the Addabbo Bridge on Cross Bay Boulevard; Rockaway Beach Boulevard; and the Flight 587 Memorial Park in Rockaway . Ariola said she is focused on quality-of-life issues, and cleaning up dirty streets is a step in the right direction. “By deploying these dedicated individuals to regular litter hot spots throughout the week, we can make sure that our neighborhoods remain clean and tidy – and clean streets are a major component of maintaining the quality of life that District 32 residents deserve,” Ariola said, who often posts photos of the cleanups on her social media pages .

Meanwhile, Ariola is also getting extra help from a number of city agencies to clean her district. She has partnered with the Woodhaven Swarm, a multi-agency initiative to clean streets in the area. According to Ariola’s office, volunteers and members from the New York City Department of Sanitation, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and NYCEDC help sweep up trash from areas in Woodhaven . In total, 650 blocks in the 32nd District were swept in 2023 through these programs, while 176 properties had their graffiti removed.

In that capacity, I’ve spent much of my time fighting to protect the FDNY’s benefits, enhance their on-the-job safety, and guarantee that all members of the Department are given the pay that they deserve. This week, I’d like to take a minute to tell you all about some of the battles we’re waging in the Council and let you know of some of the developments going on behind the scenes. One of the things that I’m most proud of is the strong stance many of my colleagues and I have taken to protect the healthcare benefits of our retirees. On January 9th, I stood on the steps of City Hall with boxes full of literally THOUSANDS of letters from our city’s retirees – each and every one of them imploring me to resist proposed amendments to our city code that would change their healthcare provider. To date, we have been successful in protecting our retirees. The city has stepped away from the switch that would transfer its current healthcare package to an unwanted Medicare Advantage program – but that battle is only on pause. It is far from over, and I and my colleagues remain vigilant for any signs from the administration that they may want to force a change in the future. For those on active duty, I’ve been working hard to address the manpower shortage that the department is currently facing. To that end, I’ve pressed to reinstate many of those firefighters who were let go as a result of COVID-19 vaccine non-compliance. Over the past year, I was able to personally get sixteen firefighters back on the job, and just this week we were able to get COVID-19 vaccination requirements lifted for new recruits. I’m also working to extend testing eligibility for EMS workers looking to be promoted to firefighters who were denied the opportunity to do so during the pandemic. Between 2020 and 2022 the EMS-to-Fire exams were suspended, meaning hundreds of potential firefighter candidates were denied the ability to join the force. By temporarily extending testing eligibility to cover those who may have gone over the age limit during this period, I’m hoping to gain a one-time, special dispensation to allow those EMS workers who were denied the opportunity to take the promotional exam to do so. I’ve been working with the FDNY to bring up this issue with the federal court monitor that oversees these age-restricted examinations, and I hope to have good news on that front soon. Speaking of our Emergency Medical Technicians and paramedics, I have also been fighting to get our EMS workers the pay that they deserve. Currently, EMS employees are woefully underpaid, and many are just barely making a living wage. This is unacceptable. I also want those men and women to be appropriately protected. All too often, our EMS is the first to arrive at a 911 call, showing up before the police and thus exposing themselves to potentially dangerous, life-threatening situations. As such, I have sponsored legislation that would provide EMS workers with Kevlar vests, so they can have some protection against any would-be assailants. This year, I will certainly have a fight on my hands as we begin the transition into the post-COVID world. Reversing many of the missteps made during the pandemic will not be easy, and addressing the manpower and capital issues of the FDNY is a struggle.

In that capacity, I’ve spent much of my time fighting to protect the FDNY’s benefits, enhance their on-the-job safety, and guarantee that all members of the Department are given the pay that they deserve. This week, I’d like to take a minute to tell you all about some of the battles we’re waging in the Council and let you know of some of the developments going on behind the scenes. One of the things that I’m most proud of is the strong stance many of my colleagues and I have taken to protect the healthcare benefits of our retirees. On January 9th, I stood on the steps of City Hall with boxes full of literally THOUSANDS of letters from our city’s retirees – each and every one of them imploring me to resist proposed amendments to our city code that would change their healthcare provider. To date, we have been successful in protecting our retirees. The city has stepped away from the switch that would transfer its current healthcare package to an unwanted Medicare Advantage program – but that battle is only on pause. It is far from over, and I and my colleagues remain vigilant for any signs from the administration that they may want to force a change in the future. For those on active duty, I’ve been working hard to address the manpower shortage that the department is currently facing. To that end, I’ve pressed to reinstate many of those firefighters who were let go as a result of COVID-19 vaccine non-compliance. Over the past year, I was able to personally get sixteen firefighters back on the job, and just this week we were able to get COVID-19 vaccination requirements lifted for new recruits. I’m also working to extend testing eligibility for EMS workers looking to be promoted to firefighters who were denied the opportunity to do so during the pandemic. Between 2020 and 2022 the EMS-to-Fire exams were suspended, meaning hundreds of potential firefighter candidates were denied the ability to join the force. By temporarily extending testing eligibility to cover those who may have gone over the age limit during this period, I’m hoping to gain a one-time, special dispensation to allow those EMS workers who were denied the opportunity to take the promotional exam to do so. I’ve been working with the FDNY to bring up this issue with the federal court monitor that oversees these age-restricted examinations, and I hope to have good news on that front soon. Speaking of our Emergency Medical Technicians and paramedics, I have also been fighting to get our EMS workers the pay that they deserve. Currently, EMS employees are woefully underpaid, and many are just barely making a living wage. This is unacceptable. I also want those men and women to be appropriately protected. All too often, our EMS is the first to arrive at a 911 call, showing up before the police and thus exposing themselves to potentially dangerous, life-threatening situations. As such, I have sponsored legislation that would provide EMS workers with Kevlar vests, so they can have some protection against any would-be assailants. This year, I will certainly have a fight on my hands as we begin the transition into the post-COVID world. Reversing many of the missteps made during the pandemic will not be easy, and addressing the manpower and capital issues of the FDNY is a struggle. But it is a struggle that I am honored to be a part of, and I look forward to tackling these challenges head-on and ensuring that New York’s Bravest are given the respect and the resources that they deserve.

This isn’t the first time that booing happened. Mayor [Bill] de Blasio was booed by the police department on multiple occasions, and we all saw what happened to the police department during the de Blasio administration and how it was destroyed and dismantled. And we cannot let remnants from that administration do that to our firefighters.” New York Attorney General Letitia James spoke at the promotion ceremony, which saw 65 uniformed members from Fire Operations, EMS Operations and the Bureau of Fire Investigation, along with 29 members of the Bureau of Fire Prevention and 34 civilian employees, sworn in to their new roles. (FDNY) The booing erupted last Thursday as James took the podium to honor the swearing-in of the first African-American woman chaplain of the FDNY, the Rev. Pamela Holmes, as well as other first responders. “Oh, come on, we’re in a house of God. Simmer down,” James told the rowdy crowd. “Thank you for getting it out of your system.” As James continued her remarks, the crowd repeatedly chanted “Trump!” The FDNY admonished firefighters for the rowdy behavior but pushed back on a report that it was “hunting” down firefighters and staffers who participated in the heckling. “We’re looking into those who clearly broke department regulations. It has nothing to do with politics. It’s about professionalism at an official event held in a house of worship,” FDNY spokesperson Jim Long told Fox News Digital in an email on Sunday morning. “Today’s ceremony was about one thing: the accomplishments of the members being promoted,” FDNY Chief of Department John Hodges said following the event. “The members whose behavior distracted from that celebration were an embarrassment and not befitting of the world’s best fire department.” The union leader who represents employees of the FDNY told Fox News Monday that, to his knowledge, no FDNY members have turned themselves in. Ariola said the firefighters should be protected under the Constitution. “They absolutely should not lose their jobs. This was their First Amendment right,” she said. “We’re looking into those who clearly broke department regulations. It has nothing to do with politics.

It is unclear what exact violation the firefighters could be accused of or how they could be reprimanded. The FDNY has a catch-all clause about “unbecoming conduct” that may be used in this situation. James filed a lawsuit against Trump last year, accusing him of inflating his real estate assets and thereby committing civil fraud. In February, a judge ruled in James’ favor and ordered Trump to pay a $350 million fine . Following the ruling, James said in an interview that she would seek to seize Trump’s assets, possibly including his lucrative NYC buildings and properties, if he is unable to pay the massive judgment.

    "text": "New York City Council Search for: Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 32 Joann Ariola Glendale, Forest Park, Ozone Park (North), Woodhaven, Ozone Park, Howard Beach-Lindenwood, Spring Creek Park, Broad Channel, Rockaway Beach, Rockaway Park, Belle Harbor, Neponsit, Roxbury, Jacob Riis Park, Fort Tilden, Breezy Point Queens Daily Eagle: We Need More Police, Not Less March 3, 2023 New York City is a city under siege. The Big Apple saw a 22% increase in major crimes in 2022 (126,537 vs 103,388 the year prior). Of those, there were 433 homicides and 1,294 shootings. In a recent New York Times article – the same one where these very figures can be read – John Jay College professor Christopher Hermann told reporters “crime is up in New York City, and it’s up quite a bit.” Crime is up, and yet some in our city want to further handcuff our police – the one group in the city that’s been proven to keep us safe. And not only do they want to handcuff the police, but they want to completely disband the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group (SRG). The men and women of the SRG are the ones who are called upon to respond to civil unrest, terror attacks, and violent crimes. They’re the ones who conduct the search for gunmen during active shooter situations. These officers bring order and safety to areas saturated with criminal activity – areas in which our understaffed police precincts are struggling to maintain a presence. These men and women go into some of the most dangerous areas of our city to keep citizens living there safe, and what do they have to show for it? A group of radical activists branding them “racist terrorists.” Let me be clear: removing the SRG will not make our city safer. It will remove a valuable tool from the NYPD’s arsenal, and it will take highly trained professional law enforcement officers off of our streets. It will increase the burden already being placed upon our beat cops, and it will no doubt lead to a further increase in crime throughout the five boroughs. Replacing these experienced officers with academic “evidence-based practices” that were tested on small groups of handpicked individuals to confirm a college thesis paper will not work in the real world. What works is empowering the dedicated men and women in blue who are out there on the streets every day, giving their time and effort to keep New Yorkers safe. And that brings me to my next point. If we really want to get serious about public safety, we need to give our police officers the respect and the salaries that they deserve. Members of the NYPD are called into extremely stressful, life-threatening situations every single day, and they do it for relatively little pay in comparison to officers elsewhere. Even in our neighboring towns and counties, police officers make better salaries – a fact which depletes our manpower pool as potential candidates opt for higher paying careers in Westchester or Suffolk. With this in mind, it is clear that we need to up the pay that we give New York’s finest. If we are going to ask them to put their lives on the line for a thankless job, we can at least pay them well to do it. We need more cops on our streets, not less, and we need more respect and more equitable pay for our officers so we can continue to attract new recruits to the department. That – and only that – will get us back on track to becoming the safest big city in America once again. And no amount of leftist rage or ivory tower theorems will change that fact.

Addabbo Jr. February 9, 2024 Senator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr. teamed up with CUNY Now! and City Council Members Joann Ariola and Lynn Schulman to bring a citizenship event to the district as part of the \"Become a Citizen: Opportunities Await\" series. The event was held on February 3, at P.S. 60 in Woodhaven. Some 140 people signed up for the event, which ran like a well-oiled machine. Everyone was helped in a professional, smooth, and timely manner. Despite the high volume of attendees, CUNY Now! staff, volunteers and lawyers had everything well organized. The program aims to assist green card holders in applying for U.S. citizenship, providing them with access to benefits such as the ability to vote, easier travel, new job prospects, increased income potential, and other financial advantages. Furthermore, the children of applicants could automatically obtain U.S. citizenship. All services at the event were provided free of charge, and participants were given guidance from the legal staff present regarding the application forms and process. Many times, at these events, attendees leave the event with a complete application package ready to be submitted to USCIS. \"I am proud to be part of this program, which offers valuable assistance to our community members seeking to become citizens,” Addabbo said. “Citizenship is not just a status; it's a responsibility and a privilege. It provides the opportunity to fully participate in and contribute to the growth and prosperity of our nation, and to shape its future for the better.\" During the event, CUNY Now! assessed attendees' eligibility for a fee waiver, potentially saving them a significant portion or the entire application fee. They received information and resources on various topics, including Civil Service job opportunities, applying to CUNY, preparing for the citizenship interview, and seeking interest-free loans for their citizenship application if they are ineligible for a fee waiver, among other valuable assistance. “My office is proud to sponsor events that help newcomers to our country LEGALLY pursue a path towards the American Dream,” said Councilwoman Joann Ariola. “Since coming into office in 2022, we’ve directly assisted over 120 constituents on their journey to citizenship, and this event was able to expand our reach exponentially.
