As Chair of the Council’s Committee on Parks and Recreation, Shekar negotiated the highest budget ever for NYC Parks. He has approached access to parks and green space as a matter of social, racial, and immigrant justice. Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Woodside are home to thousands of essential workers—many of whom are immigrants—who carried this city forward during the pandemic and continue to keep our City running. Shekar has been a champion for them, fighting to: make our community affordable and safe, invest in Elmhurst Hospital and increase access to health care for all, make sure everyone can live in dignified housing, protect taxi workers, end the practice of solitary confinement at Rikers Island, and expand public green space for neighborhoods like our own that lack it. In his first terms, Shekar has made transformative investments in our health, our safety, and our public spaces, from a new surgery clinic at Elmhurst Hospital to safe play streets around schools and new playgrounds to Jackson Heights’ first public dog run. He has worked for our community across the board- launching a comprehensive 7 point plan to make Roosevelt Ave safer, making our Jackson Heights Post Office accessible, and fighting for our seniors healthcare and programs. Before his election to City Council, Shekar was a long-time community activist in Queens and a civil rights lawyer fighting housing discrimination. He co-founded the housing legal services organization Communities Resist. Shekar is the son of immigrants from South India who made enormous sacrifices and worked tirelessly to build a life for their family in this country. He is also a father of two young children and husband to Zoe, an immigration public defender and reproductive justice advocate.

See our goals and what we’ve achieved. GO TO OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS PAGE Shekar has spent years fighting alongside our community as an advocate and parent. He has organized with his neighbors around a number of critical community initiatives, including: educating immigrant tenants on their housing rights; fighting for racial justice and dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline; coordinating the collection and delivery of PPE directly to the frontline workers at Elmhurst Hospital at the height of the pandemic; standing with the LGBTQIA+ community to root out hate and intolerance; advocating for safer streets for children and seniors; demanding far more public school funding; and mobilizing to protect and expand vital park space in Jackson Heights.

Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul recently launched their own a 90-day initiative called \"Operation Restore Roosevelt,\" deploying New York City Police officers and state troopers to crack down on illegal activities.

Krishnan and the advocates toured the Woodside Friends Daycare, located at 60-10 Roosevelt Ave. During the tour, Krishnan called on Mayor Adams’ administration to reverse its proposed $170 million in budget cuts to the city’s early care and education (ECE) and youth services systems. Members of the Campaign for Children (C4C) advocacy group were also in attendance and echoed Krishan’s call to the administration to address childcare needs and enrollment accessibility. The advocates cautioned that the cuts could burden already struggling working families that spend up to 63% of their annual income on childcare services.

The grounds have new colors and equipment. The benefits go deeper than the surface.

The list goes on. As Chair of the City Council’s Committee on Parks and Recreation, and as President and CEO of the YMCA of Greater New York and Co-Chair of the NYC Citywide Lifeguard & Aquatics Taskforce, we have seen firsthand the water safety challenges our city faces.

Sign Up To Volunteer with #TeamShekar! Archive recordings Bilingual Education for Jackson Heights and Elmhurst Recorded on May 18, 2021. Our vision is to bring bilingual education to every single public school in district 24 and 30. We are a community of immigrants and public school families. It is high time that our public schools support and reflect our families, values, and embrace all languages other than English in the public school curriculum. Our public schools are not doing nearly enough to support our bilingual students and families. That’s why I’m introducing my five point plan to expand bilingual education in New York City schools to make sure that every multi learner is guaranteed a seat. Trouble viewing the video? Click here. Reproductive Freedom and Birth Justice Recorded on May 13, 2021. Reproductive freedom is a vast topic, connected to every aspect of our lives, and the systems we interact with. Join us for a discussion that will touch on some of the most pressing issues of this moment, from the lessons we can learn from global efforts to decriminalize abortion, to the fight for dignity and safety for Black and brown people giving birth in our city. Trouble viewing the video? Click here. Justice for Drivers Recorded on April 29, 2021. So many of our city’s taxi drivers and for-hire vehicle drivers call Jackson Heights and Elmhurst home. But as gig workers, app-based drivers are misclassified and denied basic employee protections. Victims of a predatory lending-medallion crisis of the City’s own creation, taxi workers have suffered tremendously over the last decade, in many cases losing everything. City and state government must take aggressive action to protect all our drivers and ensure fairness and dignity for them. Join us for a discussion on how we can fight for driver justice in New York. Trouble viewing the video? Click here. Creating Open Spaces and Safer Streets Recorded on April 12, 2021. A sustainable, healthy city must center its people, parks, and public space over cars. It is urgent that we re-envision our city’s streets and who they are for. Across NYC, Jackson Heights and Elmhust rank towards the very bottom when it comes to the amount of green space. We must increase public open space in NYC, focusing on park-starved neighborhoods first. This is an urgent matter of public and environmental health. Trouble viewing the video? Click here. Apoyo Para Trabajadores Excluidos / Funding for Excluded Workers Recorded on April 15, 2021. El fondo para los trabajadores excluidos fue una victoria histórica en Nueva York. Se logró gracias a los sacrificios y a los increíbles esfuerzos de trabajadores esenciales excluidos, huelguistas y líderes. Únanse a nosotros mañana por la noche para participar en una conversación bilingüe sobre cómo se logró esta victoria y el trabajo que tenemos por delante. Trouble viewing the video? Click here. Supporting Our Seniors Recorded on April 8, 2021. Our seniors, our nanas, abuelas, thathas, and yeyes. Across our cultures, they are precious to us. Yet the city has not done nearly enough for them – from affordable housing to senior centers and accessible public transportation. Now more than ever, we must commit to providing the support and services our seniors need to age with grace in our city and to continue being a powerful force in our communities.

The humane treatment of animals must be a priority for everyone in our city. From our pets to protecting wildlife in NYC, there is so much more we can do on this front, especially following the pandemic. Trouble viewing the video? Click here. Food Access and Equity Recorded on march 18, 2021. City government must ensure that all communities have access to fresh and healthy food. Yet the pandemic revealed how far we are from that being a reality in NYC, especially for low-income neighborhoods.

Supporting Our Seniors Recorded on April 8, 2021. Our seniors, our nanas, abuelas, thathas, and yeyes. Across our cultures, they are precious to us. Yet the city has not done nearly enough for them – from affordable housing to senior centers and accessible public transportation. Now more than ever, we must commit to providing the support and services our seniors need to age with grace in our city and to continue being a powerful force in our communities.

Our vision is to bring bilingual education to every single public school in district 24 and 30. We are a community of immigrants and public school families. It is high time that our public schools support and reflect our families, values, and embrace all languages other than English in the public school curriculum. Our public schools are not doing nearly enough to support our bilingual students and families. That’s why I’m introducing my five point plan to expand bilingual education in New York City schools to make sure that every multi learner is guaranteed a seat. Trouble viewing the video? Click here. Reproductive Freedom and Birth Justice Recorded on May 13, 2021. Reproductive freedom is a vast topic, connected to every aspect of our lives, and the systems we interact with.

But as gig workers, app-based drivers are misclassified and denied basic employee protections. Victims of a predatory lending-medallion crisis of the City’s own creation, taxi workers have suffered tremendously over the last decade, in many cases losing everything. City and state government must take aggressive action to protect all our drivers and ensure fairness and dignity for them. Join us for a discussion on how we can fight for driver justice in New York.

It is urgent that we re-envision our city’s streets and who they are for. Across NYC, Jackson Heights and Elmhust rank towards the very bottom when it comes to the amount of green space. We must increase public open space in NYC, focusing on park-starved neighborhoods first. This is an urgent matter of public and environmental health. Trouble viewing the video? Click here.

But as gig workers, app-based drivers are misclassified and denied basic employee protections. Victims of a predatory lending-medallion crisis of the City’s own creation, taxi workers have suffered tremendously over the last decade, in many cases losing everything. City and state government must take aggressive action to protect all our drivers and ensure fairness and dignity for them. Join us for a discussion on how we can fight for driver justice in New York.

Across NYC, Jackson Heights and Elmhust rank towards the very bottom when it comes to the amount of green space. We must increase public open space in NYC, focusing on park-starved neighborhoods first. This is an urgent matter of public and environmental health.

A new program called, Queens Hate Crime Victim Advocacy Initiative, was introduced by New York LGBT Network president & founder Dr. David Kilmnick which aims to stem hate crimes and anti-LGBT discrimination in the Borough. As of June, it has been reported that hate crimes against the LGBT Community increased 46%. Community volunteers and participants in public programming on the Open Streets have been repeatedly subjected to vulgar homophobic slurs by members of the Jackson Heights Coops Alliance. Despite its designation as the birthplace of the Queens Pride Parade and a longtime “safe haven” for LGBTQ New Yorkers, Jackson Heights continues to see a steady rise in hate crimes against LGBTQ community members. “Our LGBTQ Community Center nearby has received an average of three reported anti-LGBTQ hate crime reports per week,” said David Kilmnick, President & founder of the New York LGBT Network. “The harassment that Jim has endured on the Open Streets unfortunately represents a broader trend in Queens. That’s why we are launching a new Queens Hate Crime Victim Advocacy Initiative to support all victims of such hate across the borough. We are also calling out the Jackson Heights Coops Alliance to condemn this behavior that is not acceptable anywhere, especially not in the birthplace of the LGBTQ movement in Queens.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr said, “I stand with Jackson Heights residents against homophobia and all forms of hate. The 34th Avenue Open Street is a real jewel in the Borough of Queens. It is home to so much incredible community programming. I am proud to have been an early and strong supporter of this dynamic space. That will not change. I will continue to work with Council Member Krishnan and all of our community partners to ensure that it remains a safe place for all who wish to use it.” “Misinformation disseminated by this group has caused unnecessary strife in the community and directed hate towards our volunteers,” said Jim Burke, Co-founder of the 34th Avenue Open Streets Coalition. “Purported members of this group have used homophobic, xenophobic, and racist slurs against our volunteers and program participants, sometimes in the presence of children and community members.” “Hate has no place in Jackson Heights, the birthplace of Queens Pride. I am appalled at the homophobic harassment that 34th Avenue volunteers like Jim Burke and many other have had to experience by members of the so-called Jackson Heights Coops Alliance,” said Shekar Krishnan, New York City Council Member for the 25th District. “I stand with them, the LGBT Network and longtime LGBTQIA activist and former Council Member Danny Dromm in condemning such bigotry. No matter how their members may feel about 34th Avenue, there is no excuse to engage in hate. Jackson Heights Coops Alliance must condemn its members’ actions now.” “Jackson Heights is the home of Queens Pride, but we have also seen terrible violence against LGBT individuals in our community,” said Danny Dromm, Co-founder of Queens Pride and former New York City Council Member. “Julio Rivera was murdered by three white supremacists in 1990. Edgar Garzon was murdered by a white supremacist in 2001. We must call out and condemn homophobia wherever and whenever we see it.

He is the first Indian-American ever elected to the City Council in NYC history. Shekar is also Chair of the Council’s Committee On Parks and Recreation. He negotiated the highest budget ever for NYC Parks. As Parks Chair, Shekar has approached access to parks and expanding green space as a key component of social, racial, and immigrant justice. Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Woodside are home to thousands of essential workers—many of whom are immigrants—who have carried this city forward during the pandemic. Shekar has championed a number of issues affecting our most vulnerable communities. He has been on the front lines fighting to: make sure the NYC government protects our taxi workers ; secure badly needed resources for public hospitals like Elmhurst Hospital ; ensure that New York City treats housing as as human right; end the practice of solitary confinement at Rikers Island; and expand public space for neighborhoods like his own that lack it. Shekar has been a champion for the 34th Avenue Open Street, 26 blocks of pedestrian space in Jackson Heights that is the gold standard of open streets across NYC. He is also working with Elmhurst Hospital to open a new infectious disease clinic, successfully advocated for Elmhurst’s Frank O’Connor Playground to be selected by the Parks Department as the Queens park slated for a full renovation under the citywide Community Parks Initiative, and built a much-needed dog run in the community. Before his election to City Council, Shekar was a long-time community activist in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst and civil rights lawyer fighting housing discrimination. He co-founded the legal services organization Communities Resist, a legal services organization highly acclaimed citywide for its community-rooted, intersectional approach to housing and racial justice in North Brooklyn and Queens. Shekar began his legal career with the landmark Broadway Triangle fair housing struggle against the City of New York, a successful case challenging a rezoning under the Fair Housing Act. He also co-founded Friends of Diversity Plaza. Located on the border of Elmhurst and Jackson Heights, Diversity Plaza has become a national symbol of how public space can bring people together. Shekar is the son of immigrants from South India who made enormous sacrifices and worked tirelessly to build a life for their family in this country. He is also a father of two small children, who can often be seen biking or scooting up and down the open 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, and husband to Zoe, an immigration public defender and reproductive justice advocate.

Council Member Krishnan, alongside representatives from Gays Against Guns, Open Plans, the 34th Avenue Open Streets Coalition, and the Friends of 34th Avenue Linear Park urged Mayor Adams to immediately designate the city’s open streets as gun-free zones under New York State’s Concealed Carry Improvement Act , which bars firearms in public schools, libraries, parks, and other public places. According to the CDC, firearms are the leading cause of death in children nationwide, followed by motor vehicles. “Guns and cars are the two leading causes of death for children in this country. New York City families mourn hundreds of lives lost each year to senseless shootings and car crashes. Like our parks, schools, and libraries, we must keep our streets free of firearms and safe for our families. We urge the Mayor to immediately designate all open streets across the city as official ‘gun-free zones,'” said Shekar Krishnan , Council Member for the 25th District . “The Supreme Court may not have an issue with it, but here in Queens, we will not accept a world where our streets and sidewalks are teeming with triggers ready to be pulled. That goes for our Open Streets too, as the entire point of their existence is to create a safe, healthy environment for families seeking to enjoy their communities as best they can,” said Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr. “Adding our Open Streets to the state’s list of sensitive locations under the Concealed Carry Improvement Act is a common-sense move that will keep families safe, and I’m proud to join with fellow gun violence prevention advocates in calling on our government partners to do just that.” “Open Streets are invaluable community spaces; they must feel safe, inclusive, and free from violence of any kind. Open Plans is proud to stand with Council Member Krishnan and others to ensure our streets are safe, enriching spaces for everyone,” said Jackson Chabot, Director of Advocacy and Organizing at Open Plans .”As a resident of Jackson Heights and an organizer for Paseo Park, I believe our community deserves a safe corridor free from gun violence and vehicular violence, two of the leading causes of death among New Yorkers,” said Luz Maria Mercado, Co-founder of Friends of 34th Avenue Linear Park.

The letter cited an egregious case where Laborers’ Local 1010 was denied the ability to object to millions in awards to Dragonetti Brothers Landscaping, despite this contractor’s conviction on multiple counts of insurance fraud in October 2022. Ten other members of the City Council’s Committee on Parks and Recreation signed onto the letter in addition to Council Member Krishnan, the Committee’s Chair. “New Yorkers trust city agencies to be responsible stewards of public resources,” said Council Member Shekar Krishnan, Chair of the Committee on Parks and Recreation. “Preventing labor unions and other members of the public from objecting to city awards to unscrupulous contractors undermines that trust. We can’t build more parks, plant more trees, or help our communities thrive unless we do so with full transparency and accountability.

Anti-drag protesters recently defaced NYC Council Member Krishnan’s district office, and shouted anti-LGBTQ epithets at drag performers at a September reading at Elmhurst Library and at a street fair organized by Assembly Member Cruz. Drag Story Hour NYC (formerly Drag Queen Story Hour NYC) produces storytelling and creative arts programs for children and teens, presented by local drag artists, in libraries, schools, and other community spaces in all five boroughs of New York City, and virtually. Council Member Shekar Krishnan said, “We have seen four incidents of hate and homophobia in our community in recent weeks, including one at my own office. Our neighbors are being targeted and we won’t stand for it. Here in Jackson Heights, we show our children to stand up for each other; we teach them that all are loved. We are proud to support the beautiful storytellers of Drag Story Hour, because their love and joy will always drown out the hate.” Drag Story Hour NYC Executive Director Oliver Click said, “We are so grateful for the outpouring of support that Drag Story Hour NYC has received in the wake of heightened national backlash and media attention. This support – from parents, teachers, libraries, city officials, and local community organizations – has enabled us to not only continue our programming as usual, but to expand our outreach and bring our mission of celebrating creativity, empathy, and joyful self-expression to the communities that need it most.” Queens Public Library President and CEO Dennis M. Walcott said, “Queens Public Library has hosted Drag Story Hours since 2018. They inspire a love of reading, while teaching deeper lessons on diversity, understanding, and appreciation of others. Given the ongoing attempts across this country to silence and devalue ideas through hateful behavior and book bans and challenges, the Library’s role is exceedingly important. We provide free access to knowledge, opportunity, and diverse – even dissonant, uncomfortable, or provocative – voices and points of view. We are committed to continuing Drag Story Hour, and I want to thank Councilmember Shekar Krishnan for his support of the program. Queens Public Library stands firmly behind the LGBTQ+ community in our borough, in our city, and across the country, as well as with our dedicated library staff at Jackson Heights Library and elsewhere who are committed to inclusive service for all.” Assembly Member Catalina Cruz said, “The culturally rich and diverse history and composition of the Jackson Heights community is what makes us the most unique in the State, and possibly the country. We stand united here today with a clear message – hate has no home here. We proudly welcome the Drag Story Hour to our community, and remain committed to programming that enhances and educates our families and neighbors.” Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas said, “There’s no place for LGBTQIA+ hate in our community. The neighborhoods that I represent in Queens aren’t only racially, ethnically, and religiously diverse, but diverse in gender identity and sexual orientation as well. We must celebrate and uplift diversity in all its forms and combat hate whenever we see it. I’m proud to continue my fight in the district and Albany for LGBTQIA+ justice, and I’m honored to have stood in solidarity with the LGBTQIA+ community at today’s Drag Story Hour.” State Senator Jessica Ramos said, “There are many parents, myself included, who are choosing to raise their children in Jackson Heights because we want our children immersed in diversity. I’ll welcome the joy that Drag Story Hour offers over the bigotry of a loud, select few any day.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr. said, “Drag Story Hour enriches our children’s lives with their engaging and exciting stories while teaching them the values of empathy and respect for others, as well as themselves. I am beyond proud to say that this incredible program, and our LGBTQIA+ community across Queens, will always have the unabashed support it"

We must celebrate and uplift diversity in all its forms and combat hate whenever we see it.

I’ll welcome the joy that Drag Story Hour offers over the bigotry of a loud, select few any day.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr. said, “Drag Story Hour enriches our children’s lives with their engaging and exciting stories while teaching them the values of empathy and respect for others, as well as themselves.

July 28, 2023 New York, New York – On February 13th, New York City Council Member Shekar Krishnan, Selvena Brooks-Powers, Chair of the City Council’s Committee on Transportation, and Council Member Crystal Hudson, Chair of the City Council’s Committee on Aging sent a letter to Janno Lieber, Chairman and CEO of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, urging him to resolve the concerning discrepancy in Access-A-Ride (AAR) discounts between Fair Fares NYC and the Reduced Fare Metrocard. Currently, Reduced Fare Metrocard users do not benefit from cost savings for AAR use, and pay full fares for it. “Our call to the MTA to merge Reduced Fare riders does not come lightly.”, said Council Member Shekar Krishnan, Chair of the Committee on Parks and Recreation. “Over 1.2 million people over the age of 65 and another 1 million living with a disability are directly affected by this costly discrepancy. We must guarantee that AAR, the essential lifeline for so many New Yorkers, remains affordable and accessible.” “The Access-A-Ride program is a transit lifeline for older New Yorkers and members of the disability community,” said New York City Council Majority Whip Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Chair of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. “We must ensure this service is affordable for those who need it. The MTA should allow Reduced Fare riders to use their MetroCard for Access-a-Ride, just as Fair Fare riders do. This discrepancy harms vulnerable New Yorkers – extending the Reduced Fare discount to Access-A-Ride helps to ensure equitable access to this essential service.” “We write to Chairman Lieber because we must take purposeful steps to ensure public transit is accessible and reliable for all New Yorkers. And the discrepancy in Access-A-Ride (AAR) discounts between Fair Fares NYC and the Reduced Fare MetroCard programs are glaring shortcomings that hinder our progress toward transportation equity and disability justice in our communities.

    "text": "New York City Council Search for: Find My District Budget Committees Land Use Legislation Press Releases Translate this page Google Translate District 25 Shekar Krishnan Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Woodside NYC Council Member Shekar Krishnan Leads Passage of “HEART Act” to Make AEDs More Accessible to New Yorkers July 28, 2023 New York, New York – On June 8, the New York City Council passed the Harihareswara Expand Access to Rapid Treatment Act – or “HEART Act” – with the support of an overwhelming 50 out of 51 Council Members. The bill, introduced by Council Member Shekar Krishnan, will require the City’s Department of Health to publish data on the locations and quantities of all publicly-available automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in New York City, making the life-saving devices more accessible to any member of the public. Council Member Krishnan first introduced the bill after hearing the story of a constituent, Sumana Harihareswara, whose father died of a heart attack in 2010. The bill – now law – is named in his honor. “As we mark the end of National CPR and AED Awareness week, I’m proud to have led passage of the HEART Act, which will help more New Yorkers find AEDs to save the lives of their friends, family, and neighbors,” said Council Member Shekar Krishnan. “Heart disease is the leading cause of death in New York City, claiming hundreds of our loved ones every year. By making AEDs easily accessible across the city, we can and will prevent countless deaths from cardiac arrest.” “My father, S.K. Harihareswara, died of a heart attack in 2010,” said Sumana Harihareswara . “He was a community organizer, a priest, an independent publisher, and one of my inspirations. And then his heart stopped. Lots of us, especially people of South Asian heritage, have cardiac health issues. And COVID has weakened many people’s cardiovascular systems and led to more heart attacks. So it’s crucial for New Yorkers to know where our nearest AEDs are, and this bill gets that information where more people can get it. Too many people die when nearby AEDs could have saved them, and I’m so grateful to help us stop wasting that chance.” “The American Heart Association supports efforts designed to raise awareness about the importance of knowing how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED). When a person experiences a sudden cardiac arrest, survival depends on immediately receiving CPR from someone nearby. More than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside of the hospital each year, quickly performing CPR can double or triple the chance of survival for a person in cardiac arrest,” said Lawrence Phillips, MD, Immediate Past President of the New York City American Heart Association Board of Directors and Medical Director, Outpatient Clinical Cardiology, NYU Langone Health. “We applaud Council Member Krishnan and the rest of the NYC Council for their support of CPR and AED awareness and making sure New Yorkers are able to locate an AED when they need one.” “Automated external defibrillators save lives, and in a cardiac emergency, every precious second matters,” said Council Member Linda Lee, Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions . “As the City Council continues to advocate for the cardiovascular health of New Yorkers, I am proud to cosponsor the HEART Act to require DOHMH to report on the availability of defibrillators across our city to create better health outcomes. I applaud Council Member Krishnan for his leadership in passing this legislation that will save the lives of countless residents who may experience a health crisis.”“Cardiac arrest can happen to anyone at any moment, and having access to an automatic external defibrillator is critical in saving lives. Int 814-A provides transparency and accessibility of AEDs in public while highlighting the importance of cardiovascular health,” said Council Member Marjorie Velázquez . “I’m proud to be a part of a movement that will save countless lives, especially when waiting for hospital transport is not an option.” Posted in Statements and Press Releases NYC Council Member Shekar Krishnan Leads Passage of “HEART Act” to Make AEDs More Accessible to New Yorkers July 28, 2023 New York, New York – On June 8, the New York City Council passed the Harihareswara Expand Access to Rapid Treatment Act – or “HEART Act” – with the support of an overwhelming 50 out of 51 Council Members.

The bill, introduced by Council Member Shekar Krishnan, will require the City’s Department of Health to publish data on the locations and quantities of all publicly-available automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in New York City, making the life-saving devices more accessible to any member of the public. Council Member Krishnan first introduced the bill after hearing the story of a constituent, Sumana Harihareswara, whose father died of a heart attack in 2010. The bill – now law – is named in his honor. “As we mark the end of National CPR and AED Awareness week, I’m proud to have led passage of the HEART Act, which will help more New Yorkers find AEDs to save the lives of their friends, family, and neighbors,” said Council Member Shekar Krishnan. “Heart disease is the leading cause of death in New York City, claiming hundreds of our loved ones every year. By making AEDs easily accessible across the city, we can and will prevent countless deaths from cardiac arrest.” “My father, S.K. Harihareswara, died of a heart attack in 2010,” said Sumana Harihareswara . “He was a community organizer, a priest, an independent publisher, and one of my inspirations. And then his heart stopped. Lots of us, especially people of South Asian heritage, have cardiac health issues. And COVID has weakened many people’s cardiovascular systems and led to more heart attacks. So it’s crucial for New Yorkers to know where our nearest AEDs are, and this bill gets that information where more people can get it. Too many people die when nearby AEDs could have saved them, and I’m so grateful to help us stop wasting that chance.” “The American Heart Association supports efforts designed to raise awareness about the importance of knowing how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED). When a person experiences a sudden cardiac arrest, survival depends on immediately receiving CPR from someone nearby. More than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside of the hospital each year, quickly performing CPR can double or triple the chance of survival for a person in cardiac arrest,” said Lawrence Phillips, MD, Immediate Past President of the New York City American Heart Association Board of Directors and Medical Director, Outpatient Clinical Cardiology, NYU Langone Health. “We applaud Council Member Krishnan and the rest of the NYC Council for their support of CPR and AED awareness and making sure New Yorkers are able to locate an AED when they need one.” “Automated external defibrillators save lives, and in a cardiac emergency, every precious second matters,” said Council Member Linda Lee, Chair of the Committee on Mental Health, Disabilities, and Addictions . “As the City Council continues to advocate for the cardiovascular health of New Yorkers, I am proud to cosponsor the HEART Act to require DOHMH to report on the availability of defibrillators across our city to create better health outcomes. I applaud Council Member Krishnan for his leadership in passing this legislation that will save the lives of countless residents who may experience a health crisis.”“Cardiac arrest can happen to anyone at any moment, and having access to an automatic external defibrillator is critical in saving lives. Int 814-A provides transparency and accessibility of AEDs in public while highlighting the importance of cardiovascular health,” said Council Member Marjorie Velázquez . “I’m proud to be a part of a movement that will save countless lives, especially when waiting for hospital transport is not an option.” Posted in Statements and Press Releases NYC Council Member Shekar Krishnan Leads Passage of “HEART Act” to Make AEDs More Accessible to New Yorkers July 28, 2023 New York, New York – On June 8, the New York City Council passed the Harihareswara Expand Access to Rapid Treatment Act – or “HEART Act” – with the support of an overwhelming 50 out of 51 Council Members.

New York, NY – Today, the New York City Council passed a package of bills sponsored by Parks Committee Chair Shekar Krishnan which will accelerate the parks construction process and expand green space on certain city-owned vacant lands: Introduction 842-A requires the Department of Parks and Recreation to create a blueprint for reducing project timelines by 25% — an average of 2 years. Introduction No. 174-A requires the Department to expand its capital projects tracker to include more detailed information regarding its projects, including the reasons for delays, projected and actual cost overruns, and the length of time it took to complete each project, among other information. Introduction 680-A requires the City to conduct a survey of dead end streets, vacant City-owned land, and land alongside highway ramps to examine feasibility for planting of trees, installation of bioswales, or conversion into microparks. The passage of these bills is a landmark first step in creating a citywide blueprint to reform the capital process across all relevant agencies in NYC and increase transparency in the City’s arcane capital process. Currently, the average timeline of basic capital projects like park and library improvements is 7 to 8 years. Capital process reform is critical for NYC to more effectively build housing, parks, schools, public transportation, and resilient infrastructure. “As the pandemic pushed us indoors, it also revealed the life-saving, restorative value of public spaces,” said Shekar Krishnan, NYC Council Member for District 25 and NYC Council Parks Committee Chair . “If we are to meet the challenges of public health, public safety, & climate change in NYC, our parks will be critical. The bills passed by the Council today will empower us to build more parks, have more transparency in the capital process and expand green space in communities that desperately need it.” “This is the type of comprehensive legislation that can save our city money, get our projects built faster, and more importantly, provide safe and green parks for our citizens faster. Parks are our backyards; let’s make them better, and build them back faster,” said Adam Ganser, Executive Director, New Yorkers for Parks . “This is just the start– we need the same legislation from the New York City Council to galvanize all the agencies and entities in our city’s government that delay capital projects.” “We see this as being an issue of equity; it’s not the well resourced parks that aren’t being built up. It’s the poorer, Black and brown communities that are not receiving the attention and resources they need,” said Keisha Sutton-James, Deputy Manhattan Borough President. “This is also an issue of sustainability. 30% of our coastline is parks, so we must strengthen them in order to ensure that our city has the resiliency it needs to sustain future environmental impact.” “Public space can be used to uplift our neighborhoods — such as through parkland to boost mental and physical health, public benches to provide mobility ease for older residents, and trees to shade and clean the air,” said Juan Restrepo, Senior Organizer, Transportation Alternatives . “Intro 680 provides a pathway for the City of New York to build a more resilient and green city by putting streets to better use, as we’ve outlined in NYC 25×25. Thank you to Council Member Krishnan for passing this legislation.” “We applaud Chair Krishnan and other Councilmembers present for their leadership in passing legislation to increase efficiency, reduce delays and bring down costs of Parks Capital Projects,” said Lowell Barton, Vice President, Laborers Local 1010 . “Members of Laborers Local 1010 are ready, willing and able to perform this work, having received the necessary skills training to complete the job on time and on budget.” The “ Build Back Faster ” campaign, supported by elected officials and advocates across NYC, aims to reduce project timelines citywide by 25%. Holding agencies more broadly accountable for addressing inefficiencies would lead to over $800 million in savings for the City over"

New York, NY – Today, the New York City Council passed a package of bills sponsored by Parks Committee Chair Shekar Krishnan which will accelerate the parks construction process and expand green space on certain city-owned vacant lands: Introduction 842-A requires the Department of Parks and Recreation to create a blueprint for reducing project timelines by 25% — an average of 2 years. Introduction No. 174-A requires the Department to expand its capital projects tracker to include more detailed information regarding its projects, including the reasons for delays, projected and actual cost overruns, and the length of time it took to complete each project, among other information. Introduction 680-A requires the City to conduct a survey of dead end streets, vacant City-owned land, and land alongside highway ramps to examine feasibility for planting of trees, installation of bioswales, or conversion into microparks. The passage of these bills is a landmark first step in creating a citywide blueprint to reform the capital process across all relevant agencies in NYC and increase transparency in the City’s arcane capital process. Currently, the average timeline of basic capital projects like park and library improvements is 7 to 8 years. Capital process reform is critical for NYC to more effectively build housing, parks, schools, public transportation, and resilient infrastructure. “As the pandemic pushed us indoors, it also revealed the life-saving, restorative value of public spaces,” said Shekar Krishnan, NYC Council Member for District 25 and NYC Council Parks Committee Chair . “If we are to meet the challenges of public health, public safety, & climate change in NYC, our parks will be critical. The bills passed by the Council today will empower us to build more parks, have more transparency in the capital process and expand green space in communities that desperately need it.” “This is the type of comprehensive legislation that can save our city money, get our projects built faster, and more importantly, provide safe and green parks for our citizens faster. Parks are our backyards; let’s make them better, and build them back faster,” said Adam Ganser, Executive Director, New Yorkers for Parks . “This is just the start– we need the same legislation from the New York City Council to galvanize all the agencies and entities in our city’s government that delay capital projects.” “We see this as being an issue of equity; it’s not the well resourced parks that aren’t being built up. It’s the poorer, Black and brown communities that are not receiving the attention and resources they need,” said Keisha Sutton-James, Deputy Manhattan Borough President. “This is also an issue of sustainability. 30% of our coastline is parks, so we must strengthen them in order to ensure that our city has the resiliency it needs to sustain future environmental impact.” “Public space can be used to uplift our neighborhoods — such as through parkland to boost mental and physical health, public benches to provide mobility ease for older residents, and trees to shade and clean the air,” said Juan Restrepo, Senior Organizer, Transportation Alternatives . “Intro 680 provides a pathway for the City of New York to build a more resilient and green city by putting streets to better use, as we’ve outlined in NYC 25×25. Thank you to Council Member Krishnan for passing this legislation.” “We applaud Chair Krishnan and other Councilmembers present for their leadership in passing legislation to increase efficiency, reduce delays and bring down costs of Parks Capital Projects,” said Lowell Barton, Vice President, Laborers Local 1010 . “Members of Laborers Local 1010 are ready, willing and able to perform this work, having received the necessary skills training to complete the job on time and on budget.” The “ Build Back Faster ” campaign, supported by elected officials and advocates across NYC, aims to reduce project timelines citywide by 25%. Holding agencies more broadly accountable for addressing inefficiencies would lead to over $800 million in savings for the City over"

Introduction No. 174-A requires the Department to expand its capital projects tracker to include more detailed information regarding its projects, including the reasons for delays, projected and actual cost overruns, and the length of time it took to complete each project, among other information. Introduction 680-A requires the City to conduct a survey of dead end streets, vacant City-owned land, and land alongside highway ramps to examine feasibility for planting of trees, installation of bioswales, or conversion into microparks. The passage of these bills is a landmark first step in creating a citywide blueprint to reform the capital process across all relevant agencies in NYC and increase transparency in the City’s arcane capital process. Currently, the average timeline of basic capital projects like park and library improvements is 7 to 8 years. Capital process reform is critical for NYC to more effectively build housing, parks, schools, public transportation, and resilient infrastructure. “As the pandemic pushed us indoors, it also revealed the life-saving, restorative value of public spaces,” said Shekar Krishnan, NYC Council Member for District 25 and NYC Council Parks Committee Chair . “If we are to meet the challenges of public health, public safety, & climate change in NYC, our parks will be critical. The bills passed by the Council today will empower us to build more parks, have more transparency in the capital process and expand green space in communities that desperately need it.” “This is the type of comprehensive legislation that can save our city money, get our projects built faster, and more importantly, provide safe and green parks for our citizens faster. Parks are our backyards; let’s make them better, and build them back faster,” said Adam Ganser, Executive Director, New Yorkers for Parks . “This is just the start– we need the same legislation from the New York City Council to galvanize all the agencies and entities in our city’s government that delay capital projects.” “We see this as being an issue of equity; it’s not the well resourced parks that aren’t being built up. It’s the poorer, Black and brown communities that are not receiving the attention and resources they need,” said Keisha Sutton-James, Deputy Manhattan Borough President. “This is also an issue of sustainability. 30% of our coastline is parks, so we must strengthen them in order to ensure that our city has the resiliency it needs to sustain future environmental impact.” “Public space can be used to uplift our neighborhoods — such as through parkland to boost mental and physical health, public benches to provide mobility ease for older residents, and trees to shade and clean the air,” said Juan Restrepo, Senior Organizer, Transportation Alternatives . “Intro 680 provides a pathway for the City of New York to build a more resilient and green city by putting streets to better use, as we’ve outlined in NYC 25×25. Thank you to Council Member Krishnan for passing this legislation.” “We applaud Chair Krishnan and other Councilmembers present for their leadership in passing legislation to increase efficiency, reduce delays and bring down costs of Parks Capital Projects,” said Lowell Barton, Vice President, Laborers Local 1010 . “Members of Laborers Local 1010 are ready, willing and able to perform this work, having received the necessary skills training to complete the job on time and on budget.” The “ Build Back Faster ” campaign, supported by elected officials and advocates across NYC, aims to reduce project timelines citywide by 25%. Holding agencies more broadly accountable for addressing inefficiencies would lead to over $800 million in savings for the City over the next five years.
