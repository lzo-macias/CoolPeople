When I first began working with him I expressed my concerns about my lack of physical activity and my desire to start working out. Hector designed a program for my specific needs. He is working with me on toning by body with strength training and stretching. His goals for me are realistic and his workout routines are something I can achieve. Hector is great with giving feedback and suggestions that help with my training. He also answers any of my questions in a timely manner. Hector is showing me that with better nutrition and daily movement I will be able to reach my goals. I would highly recommend using Hector’s Fitness Advantage. I feel Hector really cares and wants you to be successful. Thank you Hector for all you have done for me!” — toney “Hector is a great coach. He works with you and helps you improve!

He offers a holistic approach to fitness which includes focusing on stretching, core work, weights and cardio - tailored to the client’s capability and interests.

He asks a lot of questions about our health (in our 60s), lifestyle and goals. He helped us reach our first health goal in a few months, and we’re now working on our next goal! Thank you Hector - for not letting us off the hook when we’re feeling lazy! We appreciate you!” — Mitch & Tessy “Hector is a first class fitness coach!
