      "stanceExplanation": "The statements reflect a progressive stance on urban development, emphasizing transit-oriented development, residential conversions, and small/shared housing, which align with progressive values of inclusivity and sustainability. The support for parking mandates and ADUs indicates a push for more accessible and affordable housing solutions. However, the presence of significant opposition to these initiatives suggests a divided perspective, preventing a higher score.",
