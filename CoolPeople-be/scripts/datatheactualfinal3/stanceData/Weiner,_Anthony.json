      "stanceExplanation": "The statements emphasize advocacy for safe, fair, and affordable housing, which aligns with progressive values focused on social equity and support for vulnerable populations. The repetition of the commitment to these principles indicates a strong emphasis on government responsibility in ensuring housing access. The lack of conservative rhetoric or market-based solutions further supports a progressive stance on affordable housing.",

      "stanceExplanation": "The statements reflect a focus on community engagement and public safety initiatives, which aligns with progressive values of reform and community involvement. However, the mention of gang prosecutions and violent crime suggests a more traditional law enforcement approach, indicating a moderate stance.
